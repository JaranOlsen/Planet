# Aether Template Collection

A set of slides designed after surveying the existing Planet deck. They emphasise practices you use most—half-image layouts,
bullet rituals, embedded videos, Insight Timer invitations, Enneagram profiles, and stat dashboards—while introducing a
cohesive “Aether” aesthetic: deep midnight blues, warm amber accents, and serif headings.

Each HTML snippet showcases specific behaviours:

- `.bullets` with `.appear` states for staged teaching points.
- `.textContent` blocks to exercise auto-scaling paragraphs.
- Full-bleed imagery, Insight Timer links, and iframe embeds mirroring the most common slide types in the repository.
- Stat grids, timelines, checklists, and cards for summarising complex material elegantly.

Copy any template into a numbered slide folder (optionally suffix with `c`/`j` if you add custom CSS/JS). The shared styles
live in `src/css/aether.css`, imported automatically by `slides.css`.
