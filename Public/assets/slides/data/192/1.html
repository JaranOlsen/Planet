                        <li class="bullet visible">Self-sufficiency, financial independence, and having enough resources become important concerns. They become enterprising, pragmatic, "rugged individualists," and wheeler-dealers. They are risk-taking, hardworking, and often deny their own emotional needs.</li>
                        <li class="bullet visible">They begin to dominate their environment, including others. They want to feel that others are behind them, supporting their efforts. They become swaggering, boastful, forceful, and expansive, acting as the "boss" whose word is law. Proud and egocentric, they want to impose their will and vision on everything, not treating others as equals or with respect.</li>
                        <li class="bullet visible">They become highly combative and intimidating to get their way, being confrontational and belligerent, which leads to adversarial relationships. They view everything as a test of wills and will not back down. They use threats and reprisals to enforce obedience from others and to keep them off balance and insecure. However, their unjust treatment makes others fear and resent them, possibly also band together against them.</li>
