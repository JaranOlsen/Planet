They may abuse food and medication as a coping mechanism, and can undermine and belittle people, while denying their aggressive or selfish motives.</li>
                        <li class="bullet visible">They can become demanding and coercive, feeling entitled to repayment from others in various forms, be it monetary or even in the form of sexual favors.</li>

This suppressed aggression might manifest as chronic health issues, burdening others with their problems. This stage often aligns with Histrionic Personality Disorder and Factitious Disorder.</li>
