  <p class="aether-paragraph appear">
    1. Begin in orbit. Sense the planet-wide context before narrowing focus.<br>
    2. Choose one luminous node that stirs genuine interest.<br>
    3. Glide closer and pause within two breaths of distance.<br>
    4. Allow your attention to settle in the bodyâ€”heartbeat, spine, jaw.<br>
    5. Invite the node's story to surface; listen without urgency.<br>
    6. Note one phrase, image, or feeling and store it in your field journal.<br>
    7. Expand back to orbit, carrying the resonance with a smile.
