                As an Eight wing Seven, you merge the assertive, protective, and dominant nature of an Eight with the spontaneous, versatile, and fun-loving traits of a Seven. This results in a strong and independent personality that seeks to assert control over their environment while also enjoying life's adventures. You are driven by a desire to protect yourself and those you care about, and you're not afraid to take the initiative to ensure your goals are met. <br><br> Your Seven wing adds a sense of spontaneity and joy to your assertive nature, making you a dynamic and lively leader. You strive for control and independence but also seek to experience life to the fullest, bringing a unique blend of strength and enthusiasm to your pursuits.
