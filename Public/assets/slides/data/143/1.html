                As a One, you are defined by your sense of responsibility, integrity, and the commitment to moral and ethical standards. You have an inner critic, a ceaseless voice that strives for perfection and order. This inner critic can be both a source of great discipline and a catalyst for stress, as it drives you to avoid mistakes and faults at all costs. <br><br> You might find yourself frequently irritated by imperfections or inefficiencies, not just in your own actions, but in the world around you. You're a natural teacher, often striving to impart your wisdom and methods to others to improve not just your life but theirs as well.
