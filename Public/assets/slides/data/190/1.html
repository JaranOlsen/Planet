                    <ol start="7">
                        <li class="bullet visible">Desperate to quell their anxieties, they can be impulsive and infantile, not knowing when to stop. Addictions and excess take a toll on them: they become debauched, depraved, dissipated escapists, offensive and abusive.</li>
                        <li class="bullet visible">Trying to flee from themselves, they act out impulses rather than dealing with anxiety or frustrations: they lose control, falling into erratic mood swings, and compulsive actions (manias).</li>
                        <li class="bullet visible">Finally, their energy and health is completely spent: they become claustrophobic and panic-stricken. Often they give up on themselves and life, falling into deep depression and despair, exhibiting self-destructive behavior including overdoses, and impulsive suicide. This level generally corresponds to Bipolar disorder and Histrionic personality disorder.</li>
