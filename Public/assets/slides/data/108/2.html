        <span class="semi-transparent">I too have experienced this. When I am at my best as a group facilitator, or a therapist, I discover this characteristic. I find that when I am closest to my </span><span class="strong">inner intuitive self</span><span class="semi-transparent">, when I am somehow in touch with </span><span class="strong">the unknown in me</span><span class="semi-transparent">, when perhaps I am in a slightly </span><span class="strong">altered state of consciousness</span><span class="semi-transparent">, then what ever I do seems to be full of healing. Then simply my presence is releasing and helpful.<br><br>There is </span><span class="strong">nothing I can do to force this experience</span><span class="semi-transparent">. But when I can </span><span class="strong">relax </span><span class="semi-transparent">and be close to </span><span class="strong">the transcendental core of me</span><span class="semi-transparent">, then I may behave in strange and impulsive ways in the relationship, ways which I can't justify rationally which </span><span class="strong">have nothing to do with my thought processes</span><span class="semi-transparent">. But these strange behaviors turn out to be right in some odd way. At those moments it seems that my inner spirit has reached out and touched the inner spirit of the other. Our relationship transcends itself and had become part of something larger. Profound growth and healing and energy are present.
