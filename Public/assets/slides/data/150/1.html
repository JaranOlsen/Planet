                As an Eight, you are strong, assertive, and protective, often taking charge of situations. You believe in fairness and justice, and you're not afraid to stand up for what you believe is right. You value directness and honesty and can be quite outspoken. <br><br> You might struggle with vulnerability, viewing it as a sign of weakness, which leads you to maintain strict control over your environment and relationships. Underneath the strong and imposing exterior, there's a desire to protect not only yourself but also those you care about.
