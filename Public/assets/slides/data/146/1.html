                As a Four, you are deeply in touch with your own emotions and long for understanding and authenticity. You have a rich inner life, often finding solace and self-expression in art, literature, or other forms of creativity. You feel different from others, and there's a persistent sense of longing for something undefined, something that will give meaning to your life or complete your identity. <br><br> At times, you may compare yourself with others, feeling as if they possess qualities that you lack. You value emotional honesty and tend to be more comfortable with melancholy than other types.
