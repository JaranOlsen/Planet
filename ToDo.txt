v    selectedNodes
v    originalSize
v        indexModifier removal - only left here
v    gutta arrowhelpers
v    check if positions of new tags update
v    go through all contexts dependent code
v    go through all pins/tags dependent code
    sort out the lng + 180 issue - seems like the spiral is turned 180 degrees compared to jaranius... i guess it might not be rotating either
    create new tags on spiral - fix intersect so that it's added there..
v    add connections
v    fix so it works for spiral too
    make straightconnections - gets visible with 'H' - make them thick like tunnels so they are well visible
    fix move-node bug, greed/hatred/delusion skips to other side of the planet (redraw connections to find)



INITIATIVES
    go through way of the gut with Thomas

    apply for a pimp

    find venue for weekend retreat in oslo and bergen

CONTENT
    -change maslow pyramid picture to one with the name of the stages

    - Triune brain
    - Anapana (etc) tips and tricks
    - Foundations of EFT

    norwegian version
        use chatGPT to translate file, add norwegian in same file

    finish converting exercises to one background image and html text (saves loading time)

    wordclouds for difficult concepts
     - try to make chatGPT write a function that creates a wordcloud based on an array of words and weights

    add beth upton, rupert spira clips

MAKE USABLE
    debug for iphone
        fix touch click controls - fixed? not quite.. CHECK IF EVENTLISTENERS ADDED DURING MESH-UI DEV MADE A DIFFERENCE

    this can be added at the beginning of my script to make sure that the DOM content is loaded before the script starts running:
    document. addEventListener ('DOMContentLoaded', () = {

SHORT-TERM DEVELOPMENT
 v   make function for drawing connections (select multiple nodes, search through tag- and connection-data and add id's to the first selected node)
v    make function for adding nodes (at intersection of cursor and context surface? inputbox for text or just "add text here"?)
        if this works can possibly change to move nodes with pointer
v    make function for changing color of nodes
 v   make function for removing nodes
 v   make function for removing connections
 v   make function for drawing arrowed and dashed connections

VR DEVELOPMENT
    - three-mesh-ui
        - test youtube / insight timer thumbnail possibility
    - buttonstates for both inputSources
    - fix gutta rotation ()
        -Perhaps with something like this:
                let nuggetPosition = nuggets[i].nugget.position.clone()
                nuggetPosition.applyMatrix4(jaranius.matrixWorld);
    
GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES
    Labyrinth
    Cities
    Rivers
    Lakes
    Riverdeltas
    Floodplanes/lush terrain next to Rivers

    Geographical names
        Desert of the real
        Sea of Empathy


LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT

    restructure / rewrite code
        context independent functions (pass context parameters)

    post-processing? bloom?

    make procedural geography

    add flyControls (see section under)

    rewrite entire click code, pinpositions, pins, tags. use source&index instead of all that jazzz...

    add stuff from notes in here?

    clickable images?

    alpha maps on colored sphere for podcast links
        https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-picking.html

    investigate how to render multiple layers of transparent object

    convert all images to webp

    Limit double-side rendering (especially on high tris geometry)

    tweak terrain colors - deeper blue oceans? higher contrast? see real photo

    make functions of init processes
    
    improve planet icon

    make design improvements to slidecarousel

    convert to functions:
    (slidecarousel buttons)

    light up area around when hover pin (create or move spotlight?)

    make background more colorful
        fog?
        nebula

    flyControls - swap between control modes
        function onClick() {

            var prevCamera = camera;

            camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(...);
            camera.position.copy( prevCamera.position );
            camera.rotation.copy( prevCamera.rotation );

            var MODE = { TRACKBALL: 0, FLY: 1 };

            switch( mode ) {

                case MODE.FLY:

                    controls = new THREE.TrackballControls( camera );

                    mode = MODE.TRACKBALL;

                    break;

                case MODE.TRACKBALL:

                    controls = new THREE.FlyControls( camera );

                    mode = MODE.FLY;

                    break;
