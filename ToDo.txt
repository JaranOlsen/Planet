INITIATIVES
    go through way of the gut with Thomas

    apply for a pimp

    find venue for weekend retreat in oslo and bergen

    suggest fagdag to aksel fagdaggruppa - how do we find that transcendental part of me?
     - exercises: stirreøvelse, speaking straight from the heart
     - challenge: some have found it, some have not, that's just the nature of this (compare to the insight puzzle), challenging to measure or graduate objectively - it took me 18 years to find it reliably (but it need not take that long - and everybody has it). qualities you have that was lacking in me. qualities i had that was instrumental in me getting there. if you try to get there - you won't, but if you don't try - you won't get there either... when we find it, it's real, but manifests differently through us (compare with håvard), it makes us blossom
     - what am i? what am I not? what is real? what is real? how can something about me be real in the strong sense? (ontological perspectives)
     - rogers: altered state of consciousness, that transcendental part of me
     - maslow: self-transcendence. ajahn chah - die before you die. (sounds dark) vigdis garbarek - den som har et ansikt å tape har en maske å miste. det er masken vår som ajahn chah oppfordrer oss til å la dø. det vi virkelig er kan ikke dø - hvis det kunne dødd så hadde det ikke virkelig vært oss.
     - gendlin: that beyond words(?)
     - hvis du prøver å finne nirvana så finner du det ikke, men hvis du ikke prøver, få finner du det heller ikke..

        - remove testBird
        v fix image path - poem not loading on ghpages

     Carl rogers - transcendental part of me on way of the gut - insight meditation: important questions - deep states = focusing+ (compare to REALLY going into feelings and the significance of that / watching a tiktok about a topic vs. delving deep into it, running 1km once a month vs. 10km every day)

    convert all images to webp

    Limit double-side rendering (especially on high tris geometry)

    tweak terrain colors - deeper blue oceans? higher contrast? see real photo

    make functions of init processes
    
    improve planet icon

    make design improvements to slidecarousel

    convert to functions:
    (slidecarousel buttons)

    improve VR controllers

    light up area around when hover pin (create or move spotlight?)

    Geographical names
        Desert of the real
        Sea of Empathy


LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT

    restructure / rewrite code
        context independent functions (pass context parameters)

    post-processing? bloom?

    make procedural geography

    add flyControls (see section under)

    flyControls - swap between control modes
        function onClick() {

            var prevCamera = camera;

            camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(...);
            camera.position.copy( prevCamera.position );
            camera.rotation.copy( prevCamera.rotation );

            var MODE = { TRACKBALL: 0, FLY: 1 };

            switch( mode ) {

                case MODE.FLY:

                    controls = new THREE.TrackballControls( camera );

                    mode = MODE.TRACKBALL;

                    break;

                case MODE.TRACKBALL:

                    controls = new THREE.FlyControls( camera );

                    mode = MODE.FLY;

                    break;

            }

        }
