    add flyControls (see section under)

USEFUL

    flyControls - swap between control modes
        function onClick() {

            var prevCamera = camera;

            camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(...);
            camera.position.copy( prevCamera.position );
            camera.rotation.copy( prevCamera.rotation );

            var MODE = { TRACKBALL: 0, FLY: 1 };

            switch( mode ) {

                case MODE.FLY:

                    controls = new THREE.TrackballControls( camera );

                    mode = MODE.TRACKBALL;

                    break;

                case MODE.TRACKBALL:

                    controls = new THREE.FlyControls( camera );

                    mode = MODE.FLY;

                    break;

            }
