      const text = `You've heard much in this conference about the skill of empathic listening. I simply want to underscore what has been said because I believe that it plays a large part in our future. I come to believe that a very sensitive listening is one of the most powerful forces for growth that I know.

      When I can let myself enter softly and delicately, the vulnerable inner world of the other person.
      When I can temporarily lay aside my views and values and prejudices.
      When I can let myself be at home in the fright, the concern, the pain, the anger, the tenderness, the confusion, which fills his or her life.
      When I can move about in that inner world without making judgments,.
      When I can see that world with fresh unfrightened eyes.
      When I can check the accuracy of my sensing's with him or her being guided by the responses I receive.

      Then I can be a companion to that inner person, pointing to the felt meanings of what is being experienced. Then I find myself to be a true helper, a welcome companion, and aid to growth and help. Listening seems such a easy word, I find it a lifetime task to achieve true listening and a task well worth the effort.

      There is another very subtle factor in the healing relationship which I have experienced and that I would call presence.  It is certainly known to physicians. ..... I to have experienced this. When I am at my best as a group facilitator, or a therapist, I discover this characteristic. I find that when I am closest to my inner intuitive self, when I am somehow in touch with the unknown in me, when perhaps I am in a slightly altered state of consciousness, then what ever I do seems to be full of healing. Then simply my presence is releasing and helpful. There is nothing I can do to force this experience. But when I can relax and be close to the transcendental core of me, then I may behave in strange and impulsive ways in the relationship, ways which I can't justify rationally which have nothing to do with my thought processes. But these strange behaviors turn out to be right in some odd way. At those moments it seems that my inner spirit has reached out and touched the inner spirit of the other. Our relationship transcends itself and had become part of something larger. Profound growth and healing and energy are present.`;
