kommer med en gang når du ble lært å ta vare på alle først."},"dp_empathic-affirmation-validation_case-nina_02":{text:"Jeg gjør alt, blir bitter, og så får jeg dårlig samvittighet for at jeg er

trenger."},"dp_empathic-affirmation-validation_case-aisha_03":{text:"En del av meg tenker at ingen kan elske meg lenge.",suggestion:"Med det du har opplevd, gir det mening at den tanken dukker opp og

å spinne. Kan vi ikke bare holde det positivt?",suggestion:"Det gir mening å være redd for å spinne. I EFT går vi sakte og trygt så følelsene kan navngis og forstås; når de blir tydeligere, letter ensomheten og valgene blir flere."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-sara_02":{text:"Hvorfor fokusere på følelser og ikke mål og produktivitetstriks?",suggestion:"Siden du er så målrettet, er det et godt spørsmål.

Vi starter med enkel sansing så systemet ditt lærer at det er trygt å legge merke til litt og si litt av gangen."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-jason_03":{text:"Hvorfor bry seg om kroppssignaler?",suggestion:"Fordi kroppen er stedet angsten viser seg først. Å spore den gir oss et håndtak å jobbe med, ikke bare tanker om den."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_01":{text:"Jeg tror dette er kjemisk. Hvordan skulle prat hjelpe?",suggestion:"Det synet gir mening. Vi kan likevel lindre ved å hjelpe systemet ditt å føle seg tryggere og ved forsiktig å navngi det som har vært holdt nede; mange merker stemningsskift når nervesystemet roer seg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_02":{text:"Jeg vil ikke gjenoppleve traumer.",suggestion:"Du blir ikke presset til å gjenoppleve noe. EFT jobber i små doser med jording, så du kan kjenne litt og komme tilbake, og bygge trygghet og valg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_03":{text:"Hva er poenget hvis jeg er nummen?",suggestion:"Nummenhet er en klok beskytter.

Jeg må være sterk.",suggestion:"Styrke er viktig her. Å lære hva som treffer deg først er ikke mykhet; det er kontroll, fordi du kan velge før knyttnever eller ord flyr."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_02":{text:"Hvorfor snakke om følelser i stedet for å bare gi meg verktøy?",suggestion:"Verktøy virker best når de passer øyeblikket. Følelsesarbeid viser oss akkurat hva som trigges og hva som trengs, så verktøyet du bruker faktisk treffer."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_03":{text:"Hvordan hjelper dette meg på jobb når folk viser manglende respekt?",suggestion:"Vi kartlegger flammepunktet så du kan kjenne første støt av ydmykelse eller frykt og svare med fast, stødig selvrespekt i stedet for et utbrudd."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_01":{text:"Er det ikke egoistisk å fokusere på følelsene mine?",suggestion:"Med din historie som omsorgsgiver gir den bekymringen mening. Å kjenne følelsene dine tydeliggjør behov og grenser, så du kan ta vare på andre på en bærekraftig måte."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_02":{text:"Hva hjelper det å legge merke til kroppen?",suggestion:"Kroppen forteller tidlig når skyld eller tristhet dukker opp; å oppdage det lar deg stoppe opp, navngi det og velge, i stedet for å bli styrt av det."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_03":{text:"Jeg vil bare ha konkrete steg.",suggestion:"Vi skal være konkrete. Kort fortalt peker følelser på behov; når vi hører dem, kan vi sette tydelige forespørsler og grenser."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_01":{text:"Å snakke om å bli forlatt gjør meg panisk. Hvorfor skulle vi gå dit?",suggestion:"Det gir mening at det er skremmende. Vi går sakte og bare så langt du vil; å berøre litt av frykten med støtte kan redusere grepet og gi mer trygghet."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_02":{text:"Hva om du forlater meg, slik som alle andre?",suggestion:"Den frykten er viktig å navngi. En del av arbeidet er å bygge en pålitelig, forutsigbar prosess, så du kan teste og kjenne hvordan jevn støtte oppleves."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_03":{text:"Hvordan hjelper dette når jeg får lyst til å skade meg?",suggestion:"Vi kartlegger hva som leder frem til trangen og finner tryggere måter å lette det uutholdelige på; å navngi og berolige kjernesmerten senker behovet for å skade."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_01":{text:"Jeg vil ha prestasjonscoaching, ikke følelser.",suggestion:"Ønske om resultater gir mening. Følelsesarbeid gir deg dataene under reaksjonene, så du kan bli mer responsiv og mindre reaktiv–både hjemme og i lederskap."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_02":{text:"Jeg kan teorien. Hvorfor snakke om det her?",suggestion:"Kunnskap hjelper; øving endrer mønstre. Vi anvender det i levende øyeblikk så systemet ditt lærer en ny respons, ikke bare ideen om en."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_03":{text:"Kona er problemet. Hvorfor fokusere på meg?",suggestion:"Det er naturlig å se problemet der ute. Når vi jobber med dine indre triggere, får du påvirkningskraft uavhengig av hva andre gjør."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_01":{text:"Prat endrer ikke det som har skjedd.",suggestion:"Sant, det endrer ikke fortiden. Det kan endre hvordan kroppen bærer den nå, så nummenhet og bølger blir mildere og livet åpner seg litt."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_02":{text:"Jeg vil ikke bli oversvømt.",suggestion:"Vi presser ikke. Vi jobber med jording og jobber i små steg så du kan kjenne litt, lande og bygge kontroll."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_03":{text:"Hvorfor merke kroppen når jeg helst vil ignorere den?",suggestion:"Fordi kroppen signaliserer fare eller lettelse før ordene gjør det; å lære de signalene lar deg styre tidligere og lide mindre."},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_01":{text:"Når jeg hører at han dater igjen, faller det tungt i brystet og jeg vil forsvinne inn i jobb.",suggestion:"Det er et tungt fall der; hvis vi blir litt ved det, hva begynner å ta form inni deg?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_02":{text:"Jeg tar meg i å smile og si at det går bra selv om øynene svir.",suggestion:"Øynene svir selv om du smiler; kan vi dvele litt ved svien og se hva den handler om?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_03":{text:"Om kvelden er leiligheten for stille, og jeg scroller til jeg blir nummen.",suggestion:"Det er noe i den stillheten; hvis vi blir litt ved delen som vil bli nummen, hva legger du merke til?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-michael_01":{text:"Å høre at jeg har gjort feil kjennes som et slag, og varme skyter opp i

føler jeg meg flat, og så flimrer det litt og jeg presser det ned.",suggestion:"Det er et lite glimt under flatheten; hvis vi blir veldig varsomt ved glimtet, hvordan kjennes det innenfra?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-laura_02":{text:"En hevet stemme gjør at magen synker og kroppen vil ut.",suggestion:"Vi kan bli ved fallet i magen i ett pust; hvordan er det fallet, og hva

hindre?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-nina_02":{text:"Jeg holder meg i bevegelse så jeg slipper å kjenne bitterheten under.",suggestion:"Det ligger et lag under all bevegelsen; hvis vi blir ved det i ett pust, hva begynner å komme til syne?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-nina_03":{text:"Å hvile vekker en stram, egoistisk følelse i brystet.",suggestion:"La oss bli litt ved den stramme følelsen; hvilken tekstur har den, og hva vil den minne deg på når du hviler?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-aisha_01":{text:"Hvis noen trekker seg, skyter panikken opp og det kjennes et hull i brystet.",suggestion:"Det er en hull-følelse idet panikken skyter; hvis vi blir ved helt i kanten, hva begynner å vise seg om hva den trenger?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-aisha_02":{text:"Jeg kan gå fra kjærlighet til raseri på minutter når jeg føler meg ignorert.",suggestion:"Det er en skarp sving der; hvis vi blir ved øyeblikket før raseriet, hva lever
