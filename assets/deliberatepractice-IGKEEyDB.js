make me spiral. Shouldn't we just keep it positive?",suggestion:"It makes sense to worry about spiraling. In EFT we go slowly and safely so feelings can be named and understood; when they are clearer, loneliness eases and choices open up."},{text:"Why focus on emotion and not goals and productivity hacks?",suggestion:"Given how driven you are, that question fits. Emotion work helps because feelings carry information about needs and limits; when we listen to them, you can set goals that actually support you."},{text:"If I start crying, will we just stay stuck there?",suggestion:"Tears make sense here. We will titrate, not drown in it; a little contact with the feeling helps it move and tells us what matters most to you."}],"case-michael":[{text:"I need anger control, not touchy feely stuff. How does talking about feelings help?",suggestion:"It makes sense to want control. In EFT we map what anger is protecting so you can catch the sting underneath faster and choose a steadier response."},{text:"Isn't this just excusing bad behavior?",suggestion:"Good to name that concern. Understanding your reactions is not excusing them; it gives you leverage to change them in the moments that count."},{text:"Why slow down when I am under pressure to perform?",suggestion:"Because slowing for seconds helps you notice the first hit in your chest; that clarity is what lets you steer instead of snapping."}],"case-jason":[{text:"Does this really help with social anxiety? I just want to be confident.",suggestion:"It makes sense to want confidence fast. In EFT we help your body recognize the fear and shame signals early so confidence can grow from feeling safer inside."},{text:"What if I blank when you ask about feelings?",suggestion:"Blanking is common. We start with simple sensing so your system learns it is safe to notice and speak a little at a time."},{text:"Why pay attention to body sensations?",suggestion:"Because your body is where anxiety shows up first. Tracking it gives us a handle to work with, not just thoughts about it."}],"case-laura":[{text:"I think this is chemical. How would talking help?",suggestion:"That view makes sense. We can still ease suffering by helping your system feel safer and by gently naming what has been held down; many people find mood shifts as their nervous system settles."},{text:"I do not want to relive trauma.",suggestion:"You will not be pushed to relive anything. EFT works in small doses with grounding so you can feel a little and come back, building safety and choice."},{text:"What is the point if I feel numb?",suggestion:"Numbness is a smart protector. We will respect it and look for small signals underneath; even a little awareness can reconnect you without overwhelm."}],"case-carlos":[{text:"Will this make me soft? I need to stay strong.",suggestion:"Strength matters here. Learning what hits you inside first is not softness; it is control, because it lets you choose before fists or words fly."},{text:"Why talk about feelings instead of just giving me tools?",suggestion:"Tools work best when they are tuned to the moment. Emotion work shows us the exact trigger and need so the tool you use actually fits."},{text:"How does this help me at work when guys disrespect me?",suggestion:"We will map the flashpoint so you can feel the first jolt of humiliation or fear and respond with firm, steady respect for yourself instead of an explosion."}],"case-nina":[{text:"Isn't it selfish to focus on my feelings?",suggestion:"Given your history of caring for others, that worry makes sense. Knowing your feelings clarifies needs and limits so you can care sustainably, not selfishly."},{text:"What will noticing my body even do?",suggestion:"Your body tells us early when guilt or sadness shows up; noticing that lets you pause, name it, and choose, instead of being driven by it."},{text:"I just want practical steps.",suggestion:"We will be practical. A brief rationale is that emotions point to needs; once we hear them, we can design clear requests and boundaries."}],"case-aisha":[{text:"Talking about abandonment makes me panic. Why would we go there?",suggestion:"It makes sense it feels scary. We will go slowly and only as you want; touching a little of the fear with support can reduce its grip and help you feel steadier."},{text:"What if you leave me like everyone else?",suggestion:"That fear is important to name. Part of our work is building a reliable, predictable process so you can test and feel what consistent support is like."},{text:"How does this help when I want to hurt myself?",suggestion:"We map what leads up to that urge and find safer ways to ease the unbearable feeling; naming and soothing the core pain lowers the need to harm."}],"case-david":[{text:"I want performance coaching, not feelings.",suggestion:"Wanting results makes sense. Emotion work gives you the data under reactions so your leadership and home life become more responsive and less reactive."},{text:"I already know the theory. Why talk about it here?",suggestion:"Knowledge helps; practice changes patterns. We will apply it to live moments so your system learns a different response, not just the idea of one."},{text:"My wife is the problem. Why focus on me?",suggestion:"It is natural to see the problem out there. Working with your inner triggers gives you influence regardless of what others do."}],"case-marcus":[{text:"Talking will not change what happened.",suggestion:"True, it cannot change the past. It can change how your body carries it now, so the numbness and waves are less extreme and life opens a little."},{text:"I do not want to get flooded.",suggestion:"We will not push. We will ground and work in small steps so you can feel a little, settle, and build control."},{text:"Why notice my body when I prefer to ignore it?",suggestion:"Because your body signals danger or

Hvordan skulle prat hjelpe?",suggestion:"Det synet gir mening. Vi kan likevel lindre ved å hjelpe systemet ditt å føle seg tryggere og ved forsiktig å navngi det som har vært holdt nede; mange merker stemningsskift når nervesystemet roer seg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_02":{text:"Jeg vil ikke gjenoppleve traumer.",suggestion:"Du blir ikke presset til å gjenoppleve noe. EFT jobber i små doser med jording, så du kan kjenne litt og komme tilbake, og bygge trygghet og valg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_03":{text:"Hva er poenget hvis jeg er nummen?",suggestion:"Nummenhet er en klok beskytter. Vi vil respektere den og lete etter små signaler under; selv litt bevissthet kan koble deg på igjen uten å overvelde."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_01":{text:"Blir jeg myk av dette? Jeg må være sterk.",suggestion:"Styrke er viktig her. Å lære hva som treffer deg først er ikke mykhet; det er kontroll, fordi du kan velge før knyttnever eller ord flyr."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_02":{text:"Hvorfor snakke om følelser i stedet for å bare gi meg verktøy?",suggestion:"Verktøy virker best når de passer øyeblikket. Følelsesarbeid viser oss akkurat hva som trigges og hva som trengs, så verktøyet du bruker faktisk treffer."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_03":{text:"Hvordan hjelper dette meg på jobb når folk viser manglende respekt?",suggestion:"Vi kartlegger flammepunktet så du kan kjenne første støt av ydmykelse eller frykt og svare med fast, stødig selvrespekt i stedet for et utbrudd."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_01":{text:"Er det ikke egoistisk å fokusere på følelsene mine?",suggestion:"Med din historie som omsorgsgiver gir den bekymringen mening. Å kjenne følelsene dine tydeliggjør behov og grenser, så du kan ta vare på andre på en bærekraftig måte."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_02":{text:"Hva hjelper det å legge merke til kroppen?",suggestion:"Kroppen forteller tidlig når skyld eller tristhet dukker opp; å oppdage det lar deg stoppe opp, navngi det og velge, i stedet for å bli styrt av det."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_03":{text:"Jeg vil bare ha konkrete steg.",suggestion:"Vi skal være konkrete. Kort fortalt peker følelser på behov; når vi hører dem, kan vi sette tydelige forespørsler og grenser."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_01":{text:"Å snakke om å bli forlatt gjør meg panisk. Hvorfor skulle vi gå dit?",suggestion:"Det gir mening at det er skremmende. Vi går sakte og bare så langt du vil; å berøre litt av frykten med støtte kan redusere grepet og gi mer trygghet."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_02":{text:"Hva om du forlater meg, slik som alle andre?",suggestion:"Den frykten er viktig å navngi. En del av arbeidet er å bygge en pålitelig, forutsigbar prosess, så du kan teste og kjenne hvordan jevn støtte oppleves."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_03":{text:"Hvordan hjelper dette når jeg får lyst til å skade meg?",suggestion:"Vi kartlegger hva som leder frem til trangen og finner tryggere måter å lette det uutholdelige på; å navngi og berolige kjernesmerten senker behovet for å skade."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_01":{text:"Jeg vil ha prestasjonscoaching, ikke følelser.",suggestion:"Ønske om resultater gir mening. Følelsesarbeid gir deg dataene under reaksjonene, så du kan bli mer responsiv og mindre reaktiv–både hjemme og i lederskap."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_02":{text:"Jeg kan teorien. Hvorfor snakke om det her?",suggestion:"Kunnskap hjelper; øving endrer mønstre. Vi anvender det i levende øyeblikk så systemet ditt lærer en ny respons, ikke bare ideen om en."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_03":{text:"Kona er problemet. Hvorfor fokusere på meg?",suggestion:"Det er naturlig å se problemet der ute. Når vi jobber med dine indre triggere, får du påvirkningskraft uavhengig av hva andre gjør."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_01":{text:"Prat endrer ikke det som har skjedd.",suggestion:"Sant, det endrer ikke fortiden. Det kan endre hvordan kroppen bærer den nå, så nummenhet og bølger blir mildere og livet åpner seg litt."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_02":{text:"Jeg vil ikke bli oversvømt.",suggestion:"Vi presser ikke. Vi jobber med jording og jobber i små steg så du kan kjenne litt, lande og bygge kontroll."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_03":{text:"Hvorfor merke kroppen når jeg helst vil ignorere den?",suggestion:"Fordi kroppen signaliserer fare eller lettelse før ordene gjør det; å lære de signalene lar deg styre tidligere og lide mindre."},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_01":{text:"Når jeg hører at han dater igjen, faller det tungt i brystet og jeg vil forsvinne inn i jobb.",suggestion:"Det er et tungt fall der; hvis vi blir litt ved det, hva begynner å ta form inni

sug i brystet.",suggestion:"Det lille suget er her; hvis vi gir det litt plass, hvordan kjennes det og hva ser det ut til å bry seg om?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-laura_01":{text:"Som oftest føler jeg meg flat, og så flimrer det litt og jeg presser det ned.",suggestion:"Det er et lite glimt under flatheten; hvis vi blir veldig varsomt ved glimtet, hvordan kjennes det innenfra?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-laura_02":{text:"En hevet stemme gjør at magen synker og kroppen vil ut.",suggestion:"Vi kan bli ved fallet i magen i ett pust; hvordan er det fallet, og hva

sitter mykt ved den, hva begynner å vise seg der?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-carlos_01":{text:"En skjev tone gjør brystet varmt og kjeven låser seg.",suggestion:"Varmen og låsen er her nå; hvis vi holder oss nær dem, hva ser de ut til å si på dine vegne?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-carlos_02":{text:"Når jeg husker at gutten min skvatt, er det noe i meg som synker.",suggestion:"Der er

sier at jeg trenger hjelp, skyller skylden inn.",suggestion:"Skyllbølgen av skyld er her; hvis vi sitter mykt med den, hva ser den ut til å beskytte eller hindre?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-nina_02":{text:"Jeg holder meg i bevegelse så jeg slipper å kjenne bitterheten under.",suggestion:"Det ligger et lag under all bevegelsen; hvis vi blir ved det i ett pust, hva begynner å komme til syne?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-nina_03":{text:"Å hvile vekker en stram, egoistisk følelse i brystet.",suggestion:"La oss bli litt ved den stramme følelsen;
