skvetter, hva kommer rett etter i kroppen, og hva hjelper deg å lande raskest?"},"dp_exploratory-questions_case-marcus_09":{text:"Jeg husker ikke sist jeg lo ordentlig.",suggestion:"Når du sier det, hvilken følelse dukker opp – tom, trist – og hvor lander den?"},"dp_exploratory-questions_case-marcus_10":{text:"En del av meg tenker at jeg har det best alene.",suggestion:"Hvis vi lytter til den delen, hva beskytter den deg mest mot, og hva ville den trenge for å våge et lite steg mot nærhet?"},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-sara_01":{text:"Jeg er redd for at det å snakke om følelser får meg til å spinne. Kan vi ikke bare holde det positivt?",suggestion:"Det gir mening å være redd for å spinne. I EFT går vi sakte og trygt så følelsene kan navngis og forstås; når de blir tydeligere, letter ensomheten og valgene blir flere."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-sara_02":{text:"Hvorfor fokusere på følelser og ikke mål og produktivitetstriks?",suggestion:"Siden du er så målrettet, er det et godt spørsmål. Følelser gir informasjon om behov og grenser; når vi lytter til dem, kan du sette mål som faktisk støtter deg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-sara_03":{text:"Hvis jeg begynner å gråte, blir vi sittende fast der da?",suggestion:"Tårer gir mening her. Vi doserer i små porsjoner, ikke drukner i det; litt kontakt med følelsen hjelper den å bevege seg og viser hva som betyr mest for deg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-michael_01":{text:"Jeg trenger sinnekontroll, ikke føleri. Hvordan hjelper det å snakke om følelser?",suggestion:"Det gir mening å ville ha kontroll. I EFT kartlegger vi hva sinnet beskytter, så du raskere merker stikket under og kan velge en mer stødig respons."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-michael_02":{text:"Er ikke dette å unnskylde dårlig oppførsel?",suggestion:"Fint at du sier det. Å forstå reaksjonene dine er ikke å unnskylde dem; det gir deg grep til å endre dem i de avgjørende øyeblikkene."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-michael_03":{text:"Hvorfor senke tempoet når jeg er under press til å levere?",suggestion:"Fordi noen sekunder saktere hjelper deg å merke første treff i brystet; den klarheten lar deg styre i stedet for å smelle."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-jason_01":{text:"Hjelper dette virkelig på sosial angst? Jeg vil bare bli tryggere.",suggestion:"Det gir mening å ville bli trygg fort. I EFT hjelper vi kroppen å gjenkjenne tidlige signaler på frykt og skam, så trygghet kan vokse innenfra."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-jason_02":{text:"Hva om jeg blir helt blank når du spør om følelser?",suggestion:"Blankhet er vanlig. Vi starter med enkel sansing så systemet ditt lærer at det er trygt å legge merke til litt og si litt av gangen."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-jason_03":{text:"Hvorfor bry seg om kroppssignaler?",suggestion:"Fordi kroppen er stedet angsten viser seg først. Å spore den gir oss et håndtak å jobbe med, ikke bare tanker om den."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_01":{text:"Jeg tror dette er kjemisk. Hvordan skulle prat hjelpe?",suggestion:"Det synet gir mening. Vi kan likevel lindre ved å hjelpe systemet ditt å føle seg tryggere og ved forsiktig å navngi det som har vært holdt nede; mange merker stemningsskift når nervesystemet roer seg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_02":{text:"Jeg vil ikke gjenoppleve traumer.",suggestion:"Du blir ikke presset til å gjenoppleve noe. EFT jobber i små doser med jording, så du kan kjenne litt og komme tilbake, og bygge trygghet og valg."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-laura_03":{text:"Hva er poenget hvis jeg er nummen?",suggestion:"Nummenhet er en klok beskytter. Vi vil respektere den og lete etter små signaler under; selv litt bevissthet kan koble deg på igjen uten å overvelde."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_01":{text:"Blir jeg myk av dette? Jeg må være sterk.",suggestion:"Styrke er viktig her. Å lære hva som treffer deg først er ikke mykhet; det er kontroll, fordi du kan velge før knyttnever eller ord flyr."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_02":{text:"Hvorfor snakke om følelser i stedet for å bare gi meg verktøy?",suggestion:"Verktøy virker best når de passer øyeblikket. Følelsesarbeid viser oss akkurat hva som trigges og hva som trengs, så verktøyet du bruker faktisk treffer."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-carlos_03":{text:"Hvordan hjelper dette meg på jobb når folk viser manglende respekt?",suggestion:"Vi kartlegger flammepunktet så du kan kjenne første støt av ydmykelse eller frykt og svare med fast, stødig selvrespekt i stedet for et utbrudd."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_01":{text:"Er det ikke egoistisk å fokusere på følelsene mine?",suggestion:"Med din historie som omsorgsgiver gir den bekymringen mening. Å kjenne følelsene dine tydeliggjør behov og grenser, så du kan ta vare på andre på en bærekraftig måte."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_02":{text:"Hva hjelper det å legge merke til kroppen?",suggestion:"Kroppen forteller tidlig når skyld eller tristhet dukker opp; å oppdage det lar deg stoppe opp, navngi det og velge, i stedet for å bli styrt av det."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-nina_03":{text:"Jeg vil bare ha konkrete steg.",suggestion:"Vi skal være konkrete. Kort fortalt peker følelser på behov; når vi hører dem, kan vi sette tydelige forespørsler og grenser."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_01":{text:"Å snakke om å bli forlatt gjør meg panisk. Hvorfor skulle vi gå dit?",suggestion:"Det gir mening at det er skremmende. Vi går sakte og bare så langt du vil; å berøre litt av frykten med støtte kan redusere grepet og gi mer trygghet."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_02":{text:"Hva om du forlater meg, slik som alle andre?",suggestion:"Den frykten er viktig å navngi. En del av arbeidet er å bygge en pålitelig, forutsigbar prosess, så du kan teste og kjenne hvordan jevn støtte oppleves."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-aisha_03":{text:"Hvordan hjelper dette når jeg får lyst til å skade meg?",suggestion:"Vi kartlegger hva som leder frem til trangen og finner tryggere måter å lette det uutholdelige på; å navngi og berolige kjernesmerten senker behovet for å skade."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_01":{text:"Jeg vil ha prestasjonscoaching, ikke følelser.",suggestion:"Ønske om resultater gir mening. Følelsesarbeid gir deg dataene under reaksjonene, så du kan bli mer responsiv og mindre reaktiv–både hjemme og i lederskap."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_02":{text:"Jeg kan teorien. Hvorfor snakke om det her?",suggestion:"Kunnskap hjelper; øving endrer mønstre. Vi anvender det i levende øyeblikk så systemet ditt lærer en ny respons, ikke bare ideen om en."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-david_03":{text:"Kona er problemet. Hvorfor fokusere på meg?",suggestion:"Det er naturlig å se problemet der ute. Når vi jobber med dine indre triggere, får du påvirkningskraft uavhengig av hva andre gjør."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_01":{text:"Prat endrer ikke det som har skjedd.",suggestion:"Sant, det endrer ikke fortiden. Det kan endre hvordan kroppen bærer den nå, så nummenhet og bølger blir mildere og livet åpner seg litt."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_02":{text:"Jeg vil ikke bli oversvømt.",suggestion:"Vi presser ikke. Vi jobber med jording og jobber i små steg så du kan kjenne litt, lande og bygge kontroll."},"dp_providing-treatment-rationale_case-marcus_03":{text:"Hvorfor merke kroppen når jeg helst vil ignorere den?",suggestion:"Fordi kroppen signaliserer fare eller lettelse før ordene gjør det; å lære de signalene lar deg styre tidligere og lide mindre."},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_01":{text:"Når jeg ser navnet hans dukke opp hvor som helst, synker magen og jeg føler meg liten.",suggestion:"Hvis vi blir litt ved det fallet i ett pust, hvor kjenner du det sterkest, og hvordan kjennes den litenheten på innsiden?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_02":{text:"Jeg sier til venner at det går bra mens halsen kjennes stram.",suggestion:"Den stramme halsen er her nå; hvis vi dvæler litt, hva vil den fortelle deg om det som er vanskelig å si?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_03":{text:"Kveldene føles endeløse, og jeg rydder for å holde meg opptatt.",suggestion:"Når du ser for deg

roe?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_05":{text:"Noen ganger sletter jeg bilder og leter etter dem igjen.",suggestion:"Det er et dra–og–skyv der; hvis vi sitter med begge sider, hva vil hver del

vennligheten – om så bare en svak?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_07":{text:"Jeg våkner, og så treffer det meg på nytt.",suggestion:"Akkurat i det morgenstøtet, hvor lander det i kroppen, og om det hadde en tekstur eller vekt, hvordan ville det kjennes?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_08":{text:"Jeg kjenner meg flau over at jeg fortsatt er trist.",suggestion:"Når vi legger merke til flauheten, hvilken følelse ligger under, og hva ønsker den delen skulle bli forstått?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_09":{text:"Å se par får brystet til å verke og jeg vil gå.",suggestion:"Kan vi bli litt ved den verken – hvordan er den, og hva ser den ut til å lengte etter?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-sara_10":{text:"Jeg vil ikke belaste noen med følelsene mine.",suggestion:"Hvis ‘belaste’-delen hadde en stemme, hva ville den si at den er redd skal skje hvis du slipper noen inn?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-michael_01":{text:"Når noen retter på meg, ringer det i ørene og

prøver den delen å verne deg mest mot?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-michael_03":{text:"Etter et utbrudd er det en grop i magen jeg unngår.",suggestion:"Kan vi sitte litt ved den gropa – hvilken størrelse, form eller beskjed ville den hatt om den hadde noen ord?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-michael_04":{text:"Å beklage får meg til å kjenne meg én‑ned.",suggestion:"Når vi blir ved den én‑ned‑følelsen, hva minner den deg om, og hva trenger delen som motsetter seg å beklage akkurat da?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-michael_05":{text:"Et enkelt sukk fra kona setter meg av.",suggestion:"I sekundet før du reagerer, hvilket glimt dukker opp – stikk, skam, frykt – og hvor lander det?"},"dp_empathic-explorations_case-michael_06":{text:"Hvis jeg ikke kan svaret, spenner
