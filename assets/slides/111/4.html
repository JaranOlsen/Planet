<div class="quote"><u>Poem for a rainy day</u><br><br>I know it feels as if<br>this night through which we journey<br>will never end.<br><br>Darkness <br>is all you see,<br>as you have yet to rub<br>the sleep from your eyes.<br><br>You don't believe it,<br>but one day you will<br>awake from the dream<br>and see what I see<br><br>you too,<br>are a child of light â€“<br>shining brighter than a million suns,<br>shining bright through the darkest of nights.<br><br>- Hege Fridtun</div>
