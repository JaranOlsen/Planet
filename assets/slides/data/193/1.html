They take on roles like the criminal, outlaw, renegade, and con-artist. They become hard-hearted, immoral, and potentially violent.</li>
                        <li class="bullet visible">They develop delusional ideas about their power, invincibility, and ability to prevail. This leads to megalomania, feeling omnipotent, invulnerable, and they recklessly overextend themselves.</li>
                        <li class="bullet visible">If they get in danger, they may brutally destroy everything that has not conformed to their will rather than surrender to anyone else. They become vengeful, barbaric, and murderous, exhibiting sociopathic tendencies. This level generally corresponds to Antisocial Personality Disorder.</li>
