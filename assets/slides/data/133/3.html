        <span class="appear">is the case of a 23-year-old woman who suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident in July 2005.
        She was left in a non-responsive state, or ‘wakeful unawareness’. She could open her eyes, had cycles of sleep, and wakefulness. However, she did not respond to commands and couldn’t perform voluntary movements. She stayed in this state for the next five months.
        In a first-of-a-kind study, Adrian Owen, who was then a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, decided to observe the brain function of the young woman using an fMRI, while communicating verbal cues or commands.
        The commands were the following:
        Imagine yourself playing tennis
        Imagine yourself walking through your home.
        They then observed the brain activity of the woman and compared it to healthy controls. The pattern was the same.</span>
