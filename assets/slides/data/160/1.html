                The Peaceful, Assertive Type: Easygoing, Accepting, Comfort-seeking, Protective, and Dominant. <br><br>
                As a Nine wing Eight, you blend the peace-seeking, accepting, and easygoing nature of a Nine with the assertive, protective, and dominant traits of an Eight. This combination often results in a personality that is both calm and strong, striving for peace and harmony while also capable of taking assertive action when necessary. Your desire for peace and acceptance is balanced by a strong sense of autonomy and control. <br><br> Your Eight wing adds an element of assertiveness to your peaceful demeanor, making you a force to be reckoned with when your peace or the peace of those around you is threatened. You're a protector who values peace and strives to maintain harmony, yet isn't afraid to take a stand when necessary.
