# EFT Core Skills: High-Quality Client Markers and Therapist Responses

## Overview

Below we analyze each of the 12 core Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT) skills (Exercises 1–12 from the provided material) at three difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). For each skill and level, we describe what constitutes a high-quality client statement (marker) and a high-quality therapist response. The client markers naturally reflect the emotional/interpersonal challenge targeted by the skill, sound like believable client language, and match the intended difficulty (more complexity at higher levels). The therapist responses clearly demonstrate the EFT skill in action, maintain a straightforward and empathetic tone, and model effective therapeutic interventions. Example client statements and therapist responses from the EFT exercises are included to illustrate these qualities.

## Exercise 1: Therapist Self-Awareness

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Beginner client statements for therapist self-awareness are simple and emotionally clear, each likely to evoke a distinct internal reaction in the therapist. They reflect common scenarios that naturally trigger the therapist’s own feelings or biases. For example, a client might express nervous excitement about starting therapy: “I’m excited about starting therapy with you, but I’m also kind of nervous. I’ve never been in therapy before…” . This statement is believable (a first-timer voicing both hope and anxiety) and directly conveys an emotional state (nervousness) that the therapist will feel and need to monitor internally. At the beginner level, markers tend to be straightforward (one dominant emotion like hope, anxiety, sadness, etc.), making it easier for the trainee therapist to recognize their own internal response (e.g. feeling empathy, concern, or reassurance urges).

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

In the context of therapist self-awareness, the “response” is often internal (the therapist noticing and managing their own reactions). A high-quality response at this level means the therapist remains present and non-defensive, demonstrating self-regulation rather than a spoken intervention. For instance, if a client is nervous about therapy, the therapist would internally note any urge to immediately reassure or any anxiety of their own, and instead respond calmly and empathetically. (No explicit example responses were provided in the text for this exercise’s beginner level , as this skill is about the therapist’s inner awareness.) A good beginner therapist response would be straightforward and grounded – e.g. maintaining a warm, attentive demeanor, saying something simple like “It’s completely understandable to feel nervous starting therapy” – while the therapist internally stays aware of their own comforting instincts and manages them appropriately. The key is that the therapist’s outward response remains natural and attuned to the client, because the therapist is self-aware enough to keep their own feelings (excitement, anxiety, etc.) in check.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate-level client statements for therapist self-awareness are more emotionally complex or challenging, which tests the therapist’s internal awareness. These markers often involve stronger negative emotions or provocative content that might trigger the therapist’s biases or discomfort. For example, a client might reveal a personal habit or behavior that could conflict with the therapist’s values: “I’ve smoked pot before our last few sessions… It helps me relax and feel more comfortable here. I hope you are okay with this?” . This is delivered in a casual, believable tone, but it can naturally provoke an internal reaction (the therapist might feel concerned about substance use or worry about boundaries). Another intermediate example is a client angrily fantasizing about violence (e.g., wanting to punch an unfair boss ) – a realistic expression of frustration that could make a therapist internally uneasy. High-quality markers at this level remain authentic (clients expressing shame, anger, skepticism, etc. in their own words) and are aligned to the skill by providing opportunities for the therapist to notice their internal shifts. They are a step up in difficulty: the feelings may be mixed or directed toward the therapist (e.g. probing the therapist’s religion or competence ), requiring the therapist to be very mindful of visceral reactions (like defensiveness or judgment).

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

For intermediate self-awareness scenarios, a skilled therapist response means staying emotionally grounded and empathic despite the trigger. The therapist should visibly demonstrate composure and understanding, while internally acknowledging any personal reactions. For instance, if a client pointedly asks about the therapist’s religious beliefs or expresses concern about the therapist’s competence , the therapist might feel defensive or anxious inside. A high-quality response would involve taking a breath, recognizing those feelings, and then responding openly and calmly (e.g., clarifying their background in a respectful way and affirming the client’s right to ask). The tone remains sincere and non-defensive. Even without explicit examples in the text for this level, we infer that an effective therapist would model self-regulation – for example, maintaining a warm stance with the angry or skeptical client, rather than showing irritation. The therapist’s responses would be natural (no over-rehearsed scripts) and relatively simple, focusing on empathy first. By doing so, the therapist implicitly teaches the trainee how to handle challenging client content without getting overwhelmed or reacting inappropriately – a crucial demonstration of self-awareness in practice.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced client statements for therapist self-awareness are highly charged, complex, or personally challenging scenarios that really test a therapist’s emotional equilibrium. These markers might include clients mentioning suicidal thoughts, making sexual or romantic comments toward the therapist, displaying distrust or direct criticism, or bringing up deeply traumatic material. For example, an advanced-level client might openly flirt or express attraction to the therapist in an unsure, tentative way: “For the longest time I’ve been feeling attracted to you… I wonder what it would be like if we had met under different circumstances… I just wanted to let you know that I think you’re wonderful… I was wondering if you ever thought about me that way?” . This is a believable scenario of blurred boundaries that evokes strong internal reactions (flattery, anxiety, ethical alarm) – a clear marker for the therapist to check their self-awareness. Another example is a client arriving late for the fourth session in a row, acting aloof, which might irritate the therapist, or a client alluding to suicidal relief (e.g. imagining a car crash as a “relief” from depression ). High-quality advanced markers are thus emotionally intense and potentially disorienting, yet still plausible (many therapists will encounter some version of these situations). They often combine multiple emotions (e.g. a mix of hopelessness and helplessness in a suicidal ideation scenario, or attraction mixed with anxiety in a romantic transference), making them ambiguous and challenging – exactly the kind of moments where a therapist’s self-awareness is paramount.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

At the advanced level, the therapist’s response should model grace under fire – showing how to respond helpfully while managing one’s own intense internal reaction. The therapist must clearly demonstrate the skill by neither over-reacting (e.g. panicking or scolding) nor withdrawing. For instance, in response to the flirtatious marker above, a high-quality therapist response (as illustrated in a later EFT exercise) would set gentle but firm boundaries while validating the client’s feelings. The therapist might say in a warm but professional tone: “I am glad that you feel comfortable and understood by me. The truth is, I cannot tell what you are thinking right now. It might be important for us to discuss the limits of our relationship, though, because this is a therapeutic relationship and not a romantic one.” . This response shows self-awareness — the therapist stays calm, addresses the situation openly (rather than blushing or scolding), and acknowledges their own limits. The language is straightforward (“I do not have romantic feelings toward you; our relationship is professional”) and caring. Similarly, if a client hints at suicidal thoughts, an advanced therapist response would be to remain present and express concern/empathy without alarm, while internally the therapist would be monitoring their own anxiety and proceeding to a safety assessment if needed. Overall, high-quality responses here model to trainees how to stay emotionally regulated and connected with the client: the therapist’s tone remains steady and compassionate, and their interventions (like clarifying boundaries or acknowledging the client’s perspective) are done in a natural, trusting manner. This demonstrates the essence of therapist self-awareness – using awareness of one’s own reactions to respond in the most therapeutic way possible.

## Exercise 2: Empathic Understanding

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

At the beginner level, client statements that invite empathic understanding are usually clear, straightforward expressions of feeling or personal situations, giving the therapist something concrete to empathically reflect. They naturally center on a specific emotion or concern, making it easy to identify the core feeling. For example: “I’m feeling really down today. I just can’t stop thinking about my mother who died last year.”  is a concise, believable expression of sadness and loss. Such a statement provides a clear target for empathy (grief in this case). Beginner markers for empathic understanding often involve a single dominant emotion (sadness, worry, anger, etc.) and are communicated in simple, everyday language. They sound like real clients: not overly intellectualized or vague, but heartfelt and even a bit raw (e.g., “I spent my entire day at the unemployment office, and I’m just so fed up.” – a stressed client venting frustration ). These markers match the beginner level by not being too convoluted – the emotional message is evident. This allows a novice therapist to practice basic empathy skills, like paraphrasing the feeling, without needing to decipher complex subtext. In short, a high-quality beginner marker for this skill is one where the client plainly reveals what they feel, creating an opening for the therapist to demonstrate understanding.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

A strong therapist response at the beginner stage of empathic understanding is typically a simple, clear reflection of the client’s core feeling or experience. The response shows the therapist has heard and “gets” what the client is feeling, without adding advice or analysis. It should be delivered in a warm, natural tone – as if in gentle conversation – and be easy for a trainee to emulate. For instance, in response to the grieving client above, the therapist might respond, “You’re feeling sad over this big loss.” . This example is short and straightforward, yet powerfully validating: it mirrors the client’s sadness and the reason (losing her mother) in plain words. High-quality empathic understanding responses often start with phrases like “You’re feeling…” or “It sounds like…” and then encapsulate the emotional content. Another example from the exercises: a client says they’re optimistic and ready to work on issues, and the therapist reflects, “So, it’s like now the timing is right to work on some important issues.” . The response avoids psychobabble; it’s how one might naturally acknowledge a friend’s feeling, which makes it sound authentic. For beginners, these reflections usually stick to one idea – they zero in on the main feeling. By doing so, the therapist clearly demonstrates empathic understanding as the skill: no problem-solving yet, just tuning in and showing the client they are heard. This modeling teaches trainees the foundation of EFT – to be with the client’s emotion and communicate that understanding back.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate client statements that cue empathic understanding are typically more nuanced or layered, requiring the therapist to catch multiple aspects of the client’s experience. The client might express conflicting feelings or a more elaborate situation, which is still realistic but presents a moderate challenge to empathic listening. For example, “I’m so worried that I won’t be able to pay my bills next month, and I don’t even know what I can do about it. It’s overwhelming.” . Here the client explicitly names worry and feeling overwhelmed – the marker clearly invites empathy for anxiety and helplessness. Another intermediate marker could be a mix of emotions: “I’d like to be nicer to my friends, but whenever I feel closer to anyone, I start thinking about how I’ll eventually disappoint them.” . This sounds like a real person voicing both desire and fear, which means the therapist must understand both the longing for closeness and the fear of letting others down. High-quality markers at this level remain believable (the language is still natural and first-person, not overly polished) but they often contain two or more emotional elements (e.g., hope versus worry, anger covering hurt, etc.). They match the intermediate difficulty by not being entirely straightforward – there’s a bit more to unpack – but they aren’t completely hidden either. The client usually hints at the core feelings (like “I’m so worried” or “I just get so mad”) so an attuned therapist can pick them up and reflect both the surface feeling and its deeper significance.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

An intermediate empathic understanding response will build on basic reflection skills and may capture more than one layer of the client’s experience. The therapist still demonstrates the skill by summarizing feelings, but now might acknowledge subtle nuances or dual emotions. The tone remains empathic and genuine, and the response is usually a bit longer or more detailed than at beginner level (to address the complexity). For instance, consider a client who says they and their partner fight repeatedly with no result, feeling hopeless: an intermediate therapist reflection might be, “So much back-and-forth bickering, and yet it’s like your efforts seem wasted right now?” . This response (from the exercises) picks up the client’s frustration and hopelessness by metaphorically summarizing it (“efforts seem wasted”). Another example: a client fears getting close to friends because they expect to disappoint them. The therapist could respond, “So it’s hard to feel close to someone without then having this fear of letting them down.” . This sentence shows the therapist understanding both the wish for closeness and the fear that comes right after – integrating two elements of the client’s statement. High-quality responses at this level often use connecting words (“and yet…”, “but…”) or metaphors to convey a richer understanding. They remain straightforward in language – still something a trainee could practice saying – but they model how to capture complexity in empathy. The therapist might also reflect an implicit emotion that wasn’t directly stated if it seems evident (e.g., “It’s like you are feeling very scared and lost and not sure which way to turn.”  for a client overwhelmed by financial worries). Such responses clearly demonstrate empathic attunement, and by articulating the unspoken feelings or implications, they teach trainees how to deepen the empathic connection.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced client statements for empathic understanding are more emotionally complex, ambiguous, or intense, which pushes the therapist to apply empathy in challenging scenarios. These markers might involve contradictory feelings or a client who is unsure what they feel – meaning the therapist must really listen for the underlying emotion. For example, an advanced client might say in a distressed, confused way: “I am in such a confused, distressed place today. I don’t even know what I feel or where to begin.”  . This is a realistic expression of emotional overwhelm that doesn’t come with a neat label (“confused” and “distressed” are broad). The marker here is the very lack of clarity, which challenges the therapist to empathize with confusion itself and perhaps infer what might be underneath. Another advanced marker could be a client who intellectualizes or denies their feelings: “Everything is perfect. I felt suicidal last week when my girlfriend left… But she came back… I think everything’s okay now. Maybe we should stop therapy?”  . This contains an implicit emotional rollercoaster (suicidal despair followed by denial of any problem) – the client is effectively defending against feelings. A high-quality marker like this is believable (clients often oscillate or minimize after a crisis) and fits the skill because it requires deep empathic understanding to hear the fear and hurt behind the denial. In general, advanced markers may present multiple or hidden feelings: e.g., a client mentions a traumatic event flatly or voices a harsh belief learned in childhood (“My father taught me only weak people have feelings” ), which implies buried shame or pain. These statements match the advanced level by requiring the therapist to listen between the lines, showing empathy for feelings the client might only hint at or partially reveal.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

An advanced empathic understanding response demonstrates the therapist’s ability to stay with the client’s experience even when it’s murky or intense, and to reflect it back with clarity and compassion. The therapist might need to articulate what is implicit or hold multiple feelings together in the reflection. The responses remain authentic in tone – respectful, not overly elaborate – but they show sophisticated attunement. For example, for the confused client who doesn’t know where to begin, a therapist could respond, “That sounds really difficult. You’re all tangled up, not even knowing what door to open next.” This kind of response (using a gentle metaphor of being “tangled up” or “stuck in the mud” ) conveys empathic understanding of confusion itself. It lets the client feel understood in their not knowing. Another scenario: a client insists “everything is perfect” right after a crisis. A high-quality response might gently reflect the underlying hurt: “When things feel okay, it’s like you’ve been able to stop the bleeding, but I guess the wounds underneath run really deep.” . In this example from the training material, the therapist uses an evocative analogy (“stop the bleeding… wounds run deep”) to communicate empathy for the pain the client is likely still carrying, despite saying it’s all okay. It’s delivered tentatively (“I guess…”) to respect the client’s perspective while still acknowledging the deeper feeling. In advanced responses, therapists often name multiple emotions if appropriate, for instance: “It sounds like you have very strong feelings. Both intense anger and deep, deep shame.”  (said to a client feeling anger and shame toward an abusive father). This shows the therapist understands the complex emotional mix. Throughout, the therapist’s manner is one of patience and kindness, even if the client’s content is challenging. These responses model for trainees how to maintain empathy under pressure: the therapist clearly demonstrates understanding without judgment, using straightforward language that the client can absorb. Even if the reflection is a bit longer or uses imagery, it is all in service of conveying “I get what you’re feeling (even if you don’t fully).” This level of empathic response shows mastery of the skill, capturing depth while still sounding human and supportive.

## Exercise 3: Empathic Affirmation and Validation

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

In the context of empathic affirmation and validation, beginner client statements typically involve the client expressing distress, vulnerability, or self-doubt – situations where they implicitly seek reassurance or normalization of their feelings. A high-quality marker at this level will naturally showcase an emotional experience that calls for the therapist to affirm that the feeling is understandable or acceptable. For example, a client might say: “I accidentally hit a pedestrian with my car the other day… He was taken to the hospital with broken bones. I feel so guilty!”  . This statement is very believable (the client confesses a mistake and expresses guilt), and it clearly highlights an emotion (guilt) along with self-blame. Another beginner example: “My daughter recently left for college… I’m all alone at home. I feel really sad and lonely.” . Here, the client openly states feeling sad/lonely – a valid emotional response to empty-nest – perhaps looking for the therapist to acknowledge it’s normal to feel that way. Beginner markers for this skill often come with an emotion plus a hint of self-judgment or uncertainty (“I feel X, and maybe I shouldn’t”). The language is straightforward and heartfelt (e.g., “Watching the news makes me so angry!”  or “I just feel like my world is falling apart.” ). These statements match the beginner level because the emotions are clear and not too tangled with complex narratives; the client is essentially handing the therapist a chance to say, “It’s understandable you feel that way.” A high-quality marker of this sort is authentic (not just fishing for validation, but genuinely expressing emotion) and invites the therapist to respond with empathy plus a normalizing or affirming stance.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

At the beginner level, an empathic affirmation/validation response will combine empathy (recognizing the feeling) with a statement that legitimizes the client’s experience. The therapist speaks in a warm, reassuring manner, often using phrases like “No wonder…” or “Of course you feel…” to convey that the emotion makes sense given the situation. For example, responding to the client who felt guilty about the car accident, the therapist might say: “Oh wow, that sounds very distressing. I am so sorry that happened. No wonder it has left you feeling so bad.” . In this response, the therapist not only empathizes (“sounds very distressing”) but explicitly validates the guilt as an expected reaction (“no wonder you feel so bad”). The tone is caring and not overly formal – the therapist says “Oh wow” and “I am so sorry” much as a compassionate friend might, which keeps it natural. Another example from the text: a client says they feel nervous giving presentations, and the therapist affirms “the expectation and demand… can leave one feeling so on the spot and shaky inside.” . This response validates the client’s nervousness by describing it as an understandable result of pressure (“on the spot and shaky inside”). Similarly, if a client says “I just feel like my world is falling apart” (expressing fear/panic), a validating response is: “No wonder, it just feels so scary right now, like everything around you is crumbling.” . The therapist here literally says “No wonder” – a strong validating phrase – and mirrors the client’s metaphor of the world falling apart (“crumbling”). High-quality beginner validation responses are usually brief, focus on the emotional truth of the client’s statement, and avoid any hint of dismissal or solving the problem. They model for trainees how to accept and affirm a client’s feelings as real and valid. The straightforward language (“It has left you feeling really alone and so sad.” ) shows the therapist is not doubting or minimizing the emotion. These responses teach that sometimes the most therapeutic thing to do is to convey understanding and acceptance, allowing the client to feel “okay” for feeling the way they do.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate client statements for affirmation/validation often involve more intense or complex feelings, sometimes with the client doubting themselves or feeling ashamed of their emotions – thus providing a clear opportunity for the therapist to validate. A good marker at this level might include negative self-statements or conflicted feelings. For example: “I just feel so disgusting, like I am disgusting, like a black stain – how could anyone ever love me?” . This is a powerful, very believable expression of shame and self-loathing. The client’s language (“black stain”) shows deep negativity toward self, practically begging for compassionate validation. Another intermediate marker could be: “Sometimes it’s just like I want to go crawl in my bed and stay there… where nobody will bother me.” . That statement conveys depression or overwhelm, with a hint that the client judges themselves for wanting to shut out the world. These markers are realistic – clients do voice such harsh self-criticism or despair – and they align with the skill by highlighting an emotional pain that the therapist can normalize or validate. At intermediate difficulty, the emotions may be a mix (e.g., pride vs fear, love vs worry) or may involve the client recognizing an unhealthy pattern in themselves. For instance, “I’ve had a pattern of falling for men too quickly… I’m worried I’m making the same mistake again.”  – here the client feels both excitement and worry, and possibly guilt about repeating mistakes. A high-quality marker like this invites the therapist to validate both sides: it makes sense she’s falling in love and also makes sense she’s concerned. In summary, intermediate markers present stronger or dual emotions and often some self-questioning, which challenges the therapist to provide nuanced validation that covers the complexity.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

A therapist’s validating response at the intermediate level will still clearly acknowledge the client’s feelings as valid, but may also address multiple aspects or explicitly counteract the client’s self-criticism in a gentle way. The response should be supportive and normalizing, yet not patronizing. For the client who felt “disgusting” and unlovable, a therapist might respond with deep empathy and normalization: “You just feel like there is something wrong with you… it’s just like, ‘I feel so unlovable.’ That sounds like such a difficult but important experience to acknowledge.” . This example response starts by echoing the client’s negative self-feeling (“something wrong with you, like you are just this black stain”) and then validates it by calling it a difficult but important experience – implying it’s understandable she feels that way and important that it’s coming up in therapy. The therapist essentially says “I hear how badly you feel about yourself, and it makes sense that this is very hard for you.” Importantly, the therapist does not agree that she is unlovable (which would be colluding with the inner critic), but agrees that feeling that way is very painful and real. Another example: for a client worried about repeating relationship mistakes, the therapist can affirm both sides: “On the one hand you are worried about rushing in too quickly again, but on the other hand, there’s this feeling of falling deeply in love and it feels very real.” . This validates the worry as legitimate and also validates the love as genuine – essentially telling the client both feelings make sense. For a depressed client wanting to hide in bed, a therapist might say, “Understandably, it is like [voicing the client], ‘I just want to shut my eyes and shut out all the pain,’ because the pain you are living now feels so unbearable.” . The use of “Understandably” at the start is a clear validation: it explicitly says the desire to avoid pain is a natural response to what they feel. The therapist even speaks in first-person as the client (“I just want to shut my eyes…”) to show deep understanding, and then affirms why that urge is there – because their current pain is unbearable. High-quality intermediate validation responses often use empathetic conjectures like that (“it must be so hard…”), or normalizing statements (“Of course you feel frightened – any parent would be in your shoes” for a client worried about a child in the army ). The tone remains caring and the language is not overly technical. These responses model to trainees how to convey acceptance of a client’s feelings, even when the client doubts or judges themselves. By hearing the therapist validate their feelings, clients can start to feel less “crazy” or alone in their experience, which is precisely the goal of affirmation.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced client statements that require affirmation and validation tend to involve very intense, often deeply rooted emotional conflicts, where the client might feel extremely ashamed, alienated, or uncertain about their right to feel what they feel. These markers can be quite charged: for example, a client revealing trauma mixed with cultural conflict, “My father abused me when I was a child… I feel deeply ashamed and also angry at him. However, my culture and religion say that I should respect my father.” . This statement is rich with complex feelings: intense anger and shame toward the father, plus guilt for feeling that anger because of cultural values. It’s a realistic scenario that demands the therapist to validate both the emotional pain and the inner conflict. Another advanced marker might be a client expressing a desperate unmet need: “Sometimes I used to just wish I was in the hospital dying or something so then my mom would finally notice me… Maybe she would give me the last month of my life.” . This is a heartbreaking confession of longing for a mother’s love, couched in a dramatic wish – a client might feel very vulnerable or “wrong” for admitting such a morbid fantasy. It’s exactly the kind of statement needing gentle validation (that it reflects how desperately they wanted attention). Advanced markers could also include a client expressing love or positive feelings toward the therapist that they worry might be inappropriate: “I am so happy you got assigned as my therapist… I feel I can just be myself — it’s almost a feeling of love.” . A client might immediately feel exposed or worry the feeling is too much. All these examples show how advanced markers often carry a lot of emotional weight and complexity – multiple emotions, societal or moral conflicts, or taboo feelings. They match advanced difficulty by not only stating an emotion but embedding it in context that makes the client unsure if it’s acceptable. The therapist’s task is to affirm the validity of these feelings even when the client (or others) might judge them.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

An advanced validation response must skillfully hold the client’s intense or conflicting feelings and assure the client that having those feelings is human and acceptable. The therapist clearly demonstrates empathic affirmation, sometimes by naming each feeling and validating it, or by explicitly giving permission for the feeling to exist. For the abused client torn between anger/shame and cultural respect, a therapist might respond: “That sounds like a difficult feeling. It sounds like you have very strong feelings – both intense anger and deep, deep shame.” . This response (from the examples) doesn’t yet mention the cultural conflict, but it immediately validates the existence of both anger and shame as “difficult” and “strong” (implicitly, understandable given the abuse). The therapist’s calm acknowledgement of these “deep, deep” emotions conveys that it’s okay to voice them. They might follow up by normalizing the conflict, e.g., “Of course you’d feel angry at such mistreatment, and of course you’d feel ashamed because you were taught not to feel that way – that’s a hard place to be.” A similarly strong validating response is seen for the client who wished to be sick to get mother’s attention: “Wow, that sounds so painful. To wish you could just die – that must have been so scary and hard for you. You were just longing for her to notice, longing to be seen by her.” . Here the therapist explicitly validates the longing and the pain behind the client’s dramatic statement. The therapist says “that sounds so painful” and “must have been so scary and hard,” directly affirming that anyone in that situation would hurt. Then the therapist puts into words the core need (“longing to be seen”), effectively saying, “Your wish makes sense because you desperately needed her love.” Notice the tone: compassionate, almost exclamatory (“Wow…”) at first – showing the therapist is moved – then very gentle and understanding. Another advanced example: a client expresses loving warmth toward the therapist; a validating response might be, “Feeling so much trust and a kind of love, a wonderful sense of comfort and safety.” . This response mirrors the positive feeling back with appreciative language (“wonderful sense of comfort”), signaling that the therapist is not alarmed or rejecting of that love – instead they affirm it as a feeling of trust and safety, which is positive in therapy. Overall, advanced validation responses tend to be a bit more elaborate or intense in language to meet the client’s emotion. They remain straightforward in the sense of being honest and clear (the therapist frankly says “that must have been so hard” or “you do feel a kind of love”), but they deal with heavy material. Trainees observing these responses learn how to embrace a client’s extreme or socially ‘unacceptable’ feelings with empathy and without shock. The therapist essentially communicates, “I wholeheartedly accept that you feel this way; it makes sense in context,” which is the pinnacle of empathic affirmation and can be profoundly healing for the client.

## Exercise 4: Exploratory Questions

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

For exploratory questions, the client markers are moments where the client has expressed an emotion or hint of deeper content that invites further exploration. A high-quality beginner marker is typically a statement of feeling that could be taken further – something that the therapist can gently inquire more about, especially regarding inner experience or specifics. These markers are usually succinct and emotional, leaving some “open space” for exploration. For example: “He just put down the phone in the middle of our conversation. I was so hurt.” . The client plainly states feeling hurt; a therapist using exploratory questions might sense there’s more to unpack (e.g., where the hurt is felt, or what it reminds them of). Another marker: “You should have seen how she glared at me. It made me feel so little.” . This is a realistic scenario of shame or embarrassment; it begs exploration of what “feeling little” actually felt like inside. Beginner markers for this skill often include an emotion plus a perceptual or bodily metaphor (“so little”, “blood boil”, “felt dismissed”), or a broad statement like “I don’t know if I can handle it” . These phrases signal that more detail or meaning is under the surface. The language is still natural – clients often speak this way when describing impactful moments – and it’s not overly complicated. The key is that the therapist has something concrete to latch onto (an emotional reaction) and can ask about it. The markers match beginner level by being immediate emotional events that the client describes; the therapist doesn’t have to decode much, they just need to follow the client’s statement with an exploratory question (like “What was that like for you?”). In summary, a high-quality beginner marker for exploratory questioning is a believable client statement that reveals feeling but stops short of fully exploring it, providing a doorway for the therapist’s inquiry.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

At the beginner level, an exploratory question response is a simple, open-ended question (or prompt) that encourages the client to delve a bit deeper into their experience. The therapist clearly demonstrates curiosity and guides the client’s attention to feelings, bodily sensations, or imagery associated with what they just said. The tone is gentle and inviting, not interrogative. For instance, in response to the hurt client above, a therapist might ask: “Yes, you felt so dismissed and hurt. Where do you feel that in your body as you talk about it now?” . This example from the text shows the therapist first validating (“you felt so hurt”) then immediately posing an exploratory question about bodily sensation. It’s straightforward and natural: many therapists use exactly this kind of question in focusing-oriented therapy. Another example: a client says someone’s glare made them feel small; the therapist might respond, “Can you turn your attention inside your body, maybe your stomach or your chest, and tell me what it was like when you felt so little?” . The therapist is specifically guiding the client to internally explore the feeling (localize it and describe it). High-quality exploratory questions at this level often start with “Can you…?” / “What is/was it like…?” / “Where…?” to direct the client’s exploration. They may also encourage using imagination: e.g., “Can you imagine your son’s girlfriend sitting in front of you and tell her how much you resent her?”  – here the therapist invites a safe expression of anger via imagery (an empty-chair type question). Importantly, the questions remain simple and one at a time; the therapist isn’t bombarding the client, just opening one door for the client to look through. By modeling these kinds of responses, the therapist shows trainees how to go beyond surface empathy and gently probe for deeper experience in a supportive way. The language is non-leading – it doesn’t suggest what the client should feel, only asks what they do feel or imagine. This keeps the conversation client-centered while still deepening it. Essentially, the therapist uses their understanding of EFT tasks (focusing, chair work) to craft a natural question that helps the client explore further, making it a textbook example of the skill.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

At the intermediate level, client statements suitable for exploratory questions become more complex, often revealing a partial insight or conflict that begs to be explored. These markers may involve the client touching on deeper issues but not fully articulating them, or expressing confusion that the therapist can help clarify through questions. For example: “Even though my father has passed on now, I still cannot let go of some of the resentment. I cannot help but feel there was something missing in our relationship.” . Here, the client acknowledges lingering resentment and a sense of something missing – a clear marker of unfinished emotional business that an exploratory question could delve into (like “What did you miss from your father?”). In fact, the provided client statement is directly followed by “What did you miss getting from your father?” as an exploratory therapist prompt . This shows how a good intermediate marker contains an implicit question; the client themselves says “something was missing,” inviting the therapist to ask what that was. Another example: “I mean when he starts talking, I feel like I cannot get a word in… I just shut down.” . This marker indicates a process (“shutting down”) that the client notices but likely doesn’t fully understand – perfect for exploring how they shut down. A high-quality marker like this is realistic (people often describe communication patterns and emotional reactions without deeper analysis) and sets up a targeted question (e.g., “How do you actually shut yourself down? What happens inside?” ). Intermediate markers often show some self-awareness by the client (they know a pattern or feeling is there) but lack clarity on it. They may also present a contradiction that needs gentle probing (e.g., “I love my wife, but she has developed some strange habits. I am not sure what to do.” – love vs discomfort, inviting exploration of feelings or options). The language is still client-natural; nothing is spelled out academically. These markers match intermediate difficulty by requiring the therapist to be a bit more strategic in their questioning – the therapist must identify what aspect to explore (e.g., an unmet need, a bodily process, a meaning). But the markers clearly contain those aspects, so a trained ear can pick them up.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

Intermediate exploratory questions are more tailored and specific to the client’s statement than beginner ones. The therapist demonstrates the skill by honing in on the intriguing part of what the client said and asking about it in a way that encourages insight. The questions remain open-ended and experience-near (focusing on feelings, images, bodily sensations, or specific situations), but the therapist might incorporate some of the client’s own words or metaphors. For instance, in response to the client who “cannot let go of some resentment” toward his late father, the therapist asks, “What did you miss getting from your father?” . This question is direct, yet profound – it invites the client to articulate the unmet need (“what was missing”) that he himself hinted at. It’s straightforward and uses simple language (“getting from your father”), which any trainee can model, but it strikes at the heart of the issue. Another example: a client says they shut down when their partner dominates conversation; the therapist might respond, “Somehow you just shut down. Let’s see how you do that. How do you actually shut yourself down? Where in your body can you feel yourself shutting down?” . Here the therapist first reflects (“you just shut down”) to show understanding, then uses an exploratory prompt (“Let’s see how…”) that turns into concrete questions about the process and bodily sensation. This multi-part response is still natural – it’s like a curious exploration together (“let’s see”). It shows the therapist guiding the client step-by-step to observe their internal mechanism of shutting down, which deepens self-awareness. Another scenario: a client says “I just feel so worthless,” an intermediate therapist might ask, “It is like a deep sense of feeling like such a nothing. Where do you feel that in your body…? Can you put a hand there and speak from it?”  (an amalgam of focusing instructions). This kind of question combines empathy (acknowledging “feeling like nothing”) with somatic exploration (“where in your body?”) and even expression (“speak from it”), thus modeling multiple exploratory moves in one flow. High-quality responses at this level maintain that invitational tone – note the use of “Let’s…” and open “How…?” or “What…?” questions, which avoid any judgment. They directly address the core of the marker, whether it’s an emotion needing elaboration, a bodily felt sense, or a decision the client is unsure about. By asking these questions, therapists model curiosity and encourage the client to experience and describe more rather than staying at the surface. Trainees observing this see how to use a client’s own cues to formulate questions that lead inward, all done in simple, empathetic language.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced client statements for exploratory questions often present complex or guarded situations, where the client might be resisting feeling or is overwhelmed by emotion, requiring the therapist to be especially deft in guiding exploration. These markers may feature clients who are either in denial, highly defended, or experiencing something confusing and intense that they cannot articulate well. A classic example: “I’m feeling strange right now… it’s all blurry and foggy inside… kind of warm, like a balloon floating away… Is this normal? Am I in danger?”  . This marker is advanced – the client is describing a dissociative or altered state with vivid terms (“blurry,” “floating away”) and immediately questioning it (“am I in danger?”). It’s a prime opportunity for exploratory inquiry (the therapist might help the client stay with that feeling safely to see what it is). Another advanced marker: “You’re asking me how I feel? I know how this works: If I tell you, you’re going to want to hospitalize me… I’m feeling just fine.” . Here the client is guarded and fearful of consequences if they open up – a situation where the therapist may need to explore the fear itself. A high-quality marker in such a case is that the client does indirectly reveal something (the fear of hospitalization, implying they actually have intense feelings they’re hiding). It’s realistic (clients with trauma or bad experiences may respond this way) and it challenges the therapist to find a question that gently addresses the block (e.g., exploring what they imagine would happen or what they worry will come out). Advanced markers often also include scenarios of ambivalence: e.g., “I don’t know why I stay in the relationship… it’s self-destructive, but somehow I can’t leave.”   – a client clearly torn, pointing to an emotional attachment/fear that needs exploring (like “what makes it so hard to leave?”). These markers match advanced difficulty by not being straightforward requests to explore; rather, the therapist must perceive that exploration is needed because the client is stuck, defensive, or dealing with multiple layers. The client’s language may be more abstract or defensive than emotional, requiring the therapist’s finesse to open them up. Yet, these markers are still plausible client utterances and contain enough clues (be it metaphors like floating, or logical inconsistencies like “I know I shouldn’t but I do”) to guide an experienced therapist where to inquire.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

At the advanced level, exploratory questions often need to be particularly sensitive and empowering, as the client may be in a fragile or resistant state. The therapist demonstrates the skill by carefully encouraging exploration without pushing too hard. For the dissociative “floating” client, a therapist might respond along the lines of: “It sounds like a scary feeling, and I don’t think you are in danger, but just feeling so strange and kind of blurry, as if you are floating… [pauses] It sounds hard, but can we stay with that feeling a little longer?” . This example shows a two-part strategy: first reassure (so the client feels safe to explore – “I don’t think you’re in danger”) and reflect the client’s description to ground them (“feeling so strange…floating”), then gently invite further exploration (“can we stay with it a little longer?”). The therapist’s tone here is crucial: gentle, calming, normalizing (“I don’t think you are in danger” validates the experience as not catastrophic). By doing this, the therapist helps the client explore a frightening internal state bit by bit. For the guarded client who won’t share feelings out of fear, an advanced exploratory move could be to acknowledge the fear and possibly ask about it indirectly: e.g., “I’m hearing that it feels risky to share how you’re really feeling. Maybe we could talk about what you imagine might happen if you did? What are you afraid I’ll do or think?” This kind of question isn’t in the text verbatim, but it exemplifies how a therapist might invite the client to explore their expectation or image of therapy (thus exploring the fear itself). In the provided examples, another advanced response deals with a macho client who claims only weak people have feelings. The therapist responds by evoking his internal dialogue: “So, you just hear your father’s words ringing in your ears… ‘only weak people feel…’” . While this is more of an empathic evocation, it serves exploratory ends by bringing the internalized voice into awareness. After such a statement, the therapist might ask, “What is it like to hear those words in you now? Do they make it hard to know what you feel?” – encouraging the client to examine the impact of that belief. Additionally, for ambivalent relationship clients, an advanced exploratory question might be, “Somehow you want to leave, but you cannot. I imagine that it’s like a feeling of ‘I am so afraid.’”  followed by “What do you sense you’re most afraid of if you left?” – mixing empathic conjecture with a direct exploration of the feared outcome. High-quality advanced responses thus often blend skills: they may incorporate a bit of validation or conjecture as they ask the question, to ensure the client doesn’t feel exposed or pushed. They remain straightforward in phrasing – the therapist uses clear, simple terms even when discussing complex dynamics – but are artfully aimed at the heart of the resistance or confusion. These responses teach trainees how to navigate very delicate explorations: by first creating safety (e.g., expressing empathy or normalization) and then posing an exploratory question that allows the client to approach something they’d typically avoid. The language often includes permission or tentative wording (“can we…”, “maybe…”) to respect the client’s pace. In essence, advanced exploratory questioning responses model how to gently shine a light into the client’s blind spots and encourage the client to look, without blinding or startling them.

## Exercise 5: Providing Treatment Rationale for Emotion-Focused Therapy

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

At the beginner stage, client statements prompting a treatment rationale are usually simple, curious questions about therapy or emotions. These markers reflect a natural beginner client’s uncertainty or lack of knowledge about how therapy works, especially EFT’s focus on feelings. They are straightforward and expressed without hostility – often just genuine curiosity or mild anxiety. For example: “Can you tell me more about your approach to therapy?”  or “How does therapy work?” . These are classic newbie questions, very believable (many new clients ask these). Another marker: “Why does talking about my feelings help me feel better?”  – a client trying to understand the rationale behind focusing on emotions. Such statements clearly invite the therapist to explain why we do what we do in EFT. They match the beginner level because they’re open-ended, coming from a position of not knowing, and they don’t include entrenched skepticism or complex conditions – the client is basically giving the therapist a chance to educate and reassure. The language is everyday (“talking about my feelings,” “feel better”), indicating the client isn’t familiar with jargon. High-quality markers here also include logistical questions like “I’ve never been in therapy… What do we talk about here?”  or “Should I tell you about my history?” . These show the client’s uncertainty about the process and provide an opening for the therapist to explain how EFT sessions typically go (exploring current feelings, etc.). In summary, at this level the client markers are inquisitive, naive questions or statements of confusion about therapy, and they are delivered in a neutral or hopeful tone that simply seeks information or guidance.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

A good therapist response at the beginner level of providing rationale is clear, concise, and reassuring. The therapist should answer the question in a straightforward way, avoiding heavy technical language, and emphasize how therapy (especially EFT) will help the client. The tone is friendly and confident, as if orienting the client to a new experience. For example, if asked about the approach to therapy, a therapist might respond: “Of course. In our sessions we are going to explore your emotions together, discuss how you feel about things, solve problems, and help you decide on the best course of action for you.” . This answer (from the text) hits key points in plain language: “explore your emotions,” “solve problems,” “best course of action for you.” It’s essentially a mini-orientation that covers EFT’s focus on feelings and also outcome (action), which is very reassuring to a new client. Notice it starts with “Of course,” a polite and open tone. Another example: why talking about feelings helps – the therapist says, “Talking about your feelings can help you understand what you feel so that you can better identify what you need.” . This succinctly provides a rationale (feelings -> understanding -> needs) in one sentence, which is exactly the kind of digestible explanation a beginner client needs. It’s validating the question (“it can help because…”) rather than dismissing it. For a question like “What do we talk about?”, the therapist might respond, “I like to let you decide what you want to focus on. Maybe you could take a moment, check inside, and see what feels most pressing at the moment?” . This answer does two things: it gives the rationale that the client’s priorities guide therapy, and it gently introduces the idea of checking in with feelings (“check inside”), which is an EFT principle. It’s delivered as an invitation, keeping the client in control (“I like to let you decide…”). Overall, high-quality beginner responses provide simple education about therapy’s purpose and method, often linking it to the client’s goals (e.g., “help you feel better,” “meet your needs”). They also frequently normalize the fact that these questions are common (“This is a very common concern” is something therapists might say at this stage). By modeling these responses, the therapist shows trainees how to articulate the value of EFT to clients in a way that is encouraging. The language is positive (explore, understand, help, work together) and avoids any alienating terms. These responses serve to engage the client’s collaboration and reduce anxiety by clarifying what to expect. They effectively answer the “what” and “why” of therapy in a friendly, confident manner – a hallmark of providing a good rationale.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate client statements in this category often come from clients who have some doubts or misconceptions about therapy, especially around emotions, and they voice these concerns with mild skepticism or specific scenarios. These markers are usually phrased as challenges or worries rather than pure curiosity. For example: “I’m not sure I understand how talking about my feelings will help.” . This shows the client’s uncertainty and perhaps doubt about the core premise of EFT. It’s a realistic statement – many clients, while polite, might question therapy’s efficacy in this way. Another example: “If I talk about feeling sad or angry, couldn’t I just feel worse?” . This is a concern that talking might intensify the emotions – a valid fear that invites a rationale about the process of emotional work. Similarly, “I think my feelings are irrational. Won’t talking about them make it worse?”  combines skepticism about feelings (“irrational”) with worry about consequences. These markers are high-quality at intermediate level because they clearly point to misconceptions or fears that require explanation. They are more pointed than beginner questions, showing the client might have had some negative experiences or preconceptions. The language is still layperson but includes negative descriptors (“irrational,” “make it worse”) that the therapist will need to address. Another type of intermediate marker is the client comparing themselves to others or ideals: “My friends on Facebook are always happy and positive. I want to be like that. Can you help me?” . This expresses a hope (to be happy) tinged with concern that maybe therapy can teach that – it’s an opening to explain how focusing on what’s “getting you down” can lead to genuine satisfaction rather than superficial positivity . Lastly, a more vulnerable intermediate marker: “I’m embarrassed how sad I feel all the time, and worried that if I start crying here, I won’t stop… I think I look ugly when I cry.” . This one is rich – the client feels shame about emotion and fears emotional overwhelm, which directly calls for reassurance about crying and sadness in therapy. All these markers reflect a more complex concern than beginner ones – either a cognitive distortion (“feelings are irrational”), a fear of outcome (feeling worse, crying uncontrollably), or an unrealistic expectation (always happy like social media). They remain believable and come from a client who is somewhat engaged but not fully convinced. They match intermediate difficulty as they require the therapist to correct or reframe the client’s understanding of therapy and emotion in a slightly more nuanced way than just giving basic info.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

An effective intermediate therapist response to these concerns is educational yet empathetic, addressing the client’s specific worry or misconception with a clear explanation of the EFT rationale. The therapist must validate the concern as common, then provide the reasoning or evidence behind working with emotions, in a way that’s straightforward. For example, to the client unsure how talking about feelings helps, the therapist might say: “This is a very common concern, and I appreciate you sharing it. You see, at their core, feelings give us important information, and when we’re comfortable experiencing and expressing feelings, we are usually more able to meet our needs.” . This response from the text does several things: It normalizes the concern (“very common”), thanks the client (showing it’s okay to voice doubts), and then explains the function of feelings in simple terms (feelings = information, expressing them helps meet needs). It’s a clear rationale for EFT: by understanding feelings, you can address what you truly need. The language is non-technical: “important information,” “meet our needs” – concepts anyone can grasp. For the client worried that talking about sadness or anger might make them feel worse, the therapist gives a balanced explanation: “Sometimes talking about difficult feelings can make you feel temporarily worse, although sometimes it actually makes you feel better. Overall, it is helpful to share your feelings with someone, so you feel less isolated and alone with those feelings.” . This response is excellent because it’s honest (acknowledges it can feel worse before better, which is true), yet it reinforces the ultimate benefit (feeling less alone, the healing power of sharing). The tone is educational but caring – it doesn’t dismiss the fear, it addresses it with nuance. For the “feelings are irrational” comment, the therapist responds: “I know it sometimes feels like our feelings don’t make sense, but actually there is often a lot of sense in your feelings. By giving your inner world a voice, we can work together to figure out which feelings you want to listen to and which ones are not helping you… those are the feelings we want to help transform.” . This response reframes the idea of “irrational” – it gently corrects the client by asserting feelings do have sense or purpose, and introduces the concept of discerning and transforming feelings. It’s educational (teaching that not all feelings are equal and therapy helps sort them) while also collaborative in tone (“work together”). When a client is embarrassed about crying, the therapist might respond: “That sounds like a difficult experience. You somehow feel like your sadness and tears are ugly. I actually think they are so important – and important to listen to. After all, therapy is a place that you can cry, and I imagine this is some of what we will do here together.” . This reassuring explanation normalizes crying in therapy explicitly (“therapy is a place you can cry”) and validates the value of those tears. It addresses the shame (“you feel they’re ugly, I think they’re important”) in a straightforward but caring way. Across all these examples, the therapist clearly demonstrates the rationale behind EFT techniques (sharing feelings, focusing on emotions) in a patient and pedagogical tone. They don’t lecture; they speak as if explaining kindly to a friend why this approach matters, often using “we” to convey a team effort and “you” to personalize the benefit. They anticipate the client’s feelings (e.g., not wanting to feel isolated, wanting to be understood, needing safety to cry) and incorporate that into the rationale, which makes the explanation resonate more. For trainees, these responses model how to combine psychoeducation with empathy: answering the question accurately and showing understanding of the fear behind it. The language is still everyday (no jargon like “affect regulation” or “attachment needs” – instead they say “less alone,” “figure out,” “transform feelings”). That ensures the client truly comprehends the rationale, which is the goal. A high-quality rationale response empowers the client with knowledge about why they should engage in the therapy process, thereby strengthening the therapeutic alliance and motivation.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced client statements asking for rationale are typically more challenging, often voiced by highly skeptical or fearful clients, or those with prior negative therapy experiences. These markers might come off as confrontational or laced with doubt, requiring a very robust and nuanced explanation from the therapist. For example: “I don’t think this is going to work for me because my emotions are part of the problem. That’s what I want you to help me with, to feel less!” . This client essentially rejects the premise of feeling more – they want to suppress feelings. It’s a believable stance for someone who equates emotions with pain or dysfunction. A marker like this is high-quality because it forces the therapist to justify the entire approach (why more feeling, not less, is helpful) to a doubtful client. Another example: “How can you guarantee that if I go into my painful emotions, I am going to feel better afterward? … My experience has been that I go in there and get lost and just feel worse. How will this be different?” . This is a sophisticated challenge from a client who likely has tried therapy or self-reflection before and got overwhelmed. It’s complex: they want a guarantee and are voicing a genuine past outcome (feeling worse). Advanced markers like this require the therapist to address both the cognitive part (the “guarantee” question) and the emotional part (fear of getting lost). They are delivered in a frank, maybe slightly demanding tone – which is realistic for someone in considerable pain or doubt. Another advanced marker: “I’ve had bad experiences in therapy before… How can I know that I am safe with you?” . This one brings in trust issues and trauma – the client needs rationale and assurance of safety. And another: “I hate that I can’t control my feelings. I believe this makes me weak. I want to control my feelings, so I can be strong. Can you help me with this?” . Here, the client’s worldview is that controlling emotion = strength. They are basically asking the therapist to do the opposite of EFT’s goal (which is to allow feelings), so the therapist must really clarify the rationale that true strength might mean something else. Finally, “My doctor said I have an anger problem… Is it safe for me to explore my feelings? Shouldn’t I just try to get rid of my anger?” . This marker shows fear that exploring anger might be dangerous or counterproductive – a very valid worry, especially if the client has history of losing control. All these advanced markers are challenging because they contain entrenched beliefs or prior experiences that contradict the EFT approach. They’re more than simple questions – they’re arguments or conditions the client is putting forth. They match advanced difficulty in that a superficial answer won’t suffice; the therapist needs to provide a comprehensive and convincing rationale while also respecting the client’s skepticism or fear. The language the client uses is often absolute (“I don’t think this will work,” “guarantee,” “I want to feel less,” “makes me weak”) – indicating a strong stance that the therapist must address head-on.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

Advanced-level rationale responses are typically more extensive and detailed, as the therapist needs to both persuade and reassure a skeptical client. The therapist should combine logical explanation with empathy, often giving examples or metaphors to concretely illustrate why EFT does what it does. For the client who believes “emotions are the problem, I want to feel less,” a therapist might respond: “I understand your experience tells you that emotions can sometimes feel dangerous or disorganizing. Here we are going to explore your feelings, but in some new ways you might not have done before. This is important as it will give us a sense of what is missing for you and what you need. Remember that I will be on this journey with you.” . This response is empathetic (acknowledging the client’s viewpoint that emotions feel dangerous) and then reframes it: we will explore emotions, but differently (implying a safer, guided method), and crucially points out the purpose (“to sense what’s missing and what you need”). It ends with reassurance of support (“I will be on this journey with you”). The tone is confident yet caring. For the client asking for a guarantee about going into painful emotions, the therapist’s answer in the text is exemplary: it’s a longer explanation that covers why emotions are healthy and what each core emotion does. For instance: “Maybe I could clarify when and why emotions can be healthy and helpful. Emotion motivates and helps you get your needs met because it tells you what is missing. For example, sadness tells you that you have lost something important to you and can allow you to let go and organize to find something new. Anger helps you set boundaries… Loneliness tells you that you need to feel connected… Anxiety and fear tell you that you do not feel safe and that you need protection. So, emotions usually tell us what we need, help us get needs met, help us remember what is important to us, and help us connect. Does that make sense?”  . In this rich response, the therapist essentially delivers a brief lesson on emotions, complete with examples for sadness, anger, loneliness, fear. It’s thorough yet still in simple terms (any layperson can understand losing something -> sadness -> let go, etc.). It directly addresses the client’s implicit question (“why go into pain?”) by showing that each painful feeling has a purpose and a payoff (e.g., sadness helps you let go and find something new, anger helps you set boundaries). This kind of explanation is very effective for convincing a skeptical client because it connects emotions to practical outcomes. The therapist ends with “Does that make sense?”, inviting collaboration and checking understanding. For the trust issue (“How can I know I am safe with you after bad experiences?”), the therapist’s response is about pacing and control: “I know it can be difficult to talk about past traumas. And we need to go slow and at a pace that you feel comfortable with. I actually do think it is important to be able to talk about what happened to you and process the feelings around it, in a safe place. How about we take it at a pace you feel comfortable with, where you decide how deep you want to go.” . This answer explicitly prioritizes safety and the client’s control (repeating “at a pace you feel comfortable,” “you decide how deep to go”). It provides rationale (“it is important to process what happened”), but envelops it in assurances of client autonomy, which directly tackles the client’s fear. For the client who wants to control feelings, the therapist might respond with a mix of validation and gentle reframing: “Yes, it can feel very distressing when you feel out of control. And it sounds like that does leave you feeling weak. I don’t believe that controlling feelings makes you stronger, but we can explore that. In many ways, I think it is strong to be able to allow your feelings… You can then have choice over when to express them. But we can discuss it. How does it sound to you?” . This response acknowledges the client’s perspective (“feeling out of control… leaves you feeling weak”), then respectfully disagrees in a collaborative way (“I don’t believe X, but we can explore that”). It offers a reframe (allowing feelings is a kind of strength, and leads to having choice), and then immediately seeks the client’s input (“How does it sound to you?”), which keeps the client engaged and not lectured at. Finally, for the anger problem scenario, the therapist might say: “I think we need to look into your anger a little further. Hitting people is not a good thing, and I agree that we need to work on it. Maybe we need to consider strategies to help you get anger under control. Also, it is important to look at what is driving that anger, what is underneath it. Sometimes it can be helpful to get to the feelings underneath your anger. This refocusing helps you actually get anger under control.” . This answer is very strategic: it first agrees with the client’s concern that uncontrolled anger is a problem (“hitting is not good, we need to work on it”). Then it offers a dual approach: manage it with strategies and explore its root. By saying “getting to the feelings underneath… helps get anger under control,” the therapist ties emotional exploration to the client’s goal of controlling anger. This is a persuasive rationale linking EFT’s focus (underlying feelings) to behavior change (not acting out anger). Throughout all these advanced examples, the therapist’s responses are lengthier and more complex, yet they remain well-organized and comprehensible. The therapist often breaks down the explanation into points or examples, which is a good teaching technique for the client. The tone is respectful; even when challenging the client’s view, the therapist uses careful language (“I don’t believe X, but we can discuss” instead of “You’re wrong”). There’s also an element of collaborative checking-in (“Does that make sense?”, “How does that sound?”) which keeps the dialogue two-sided. This is important with skeptical clients, who don’t want to be monologued at. Overall, high-quality advanced rationale responses thoroughly address the client’s doubts, using a mix of education, analogy, and reassurance, and invite the client to consider the perspective. They model to trainees how to handle tough questions or resistance with patience, knowledge, and empathy, turning potential ruptures into opportunities for strengthening the client’s understanding and trust in the therapy process.

## Exercise 6: Empathic Explorations

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

In the context of empathic explorations, which combines empathy with gentle probing, beginner client markers are emotional statements that are relatively clear but benefit from a bit more exploration to fully understand. They often contain an emotional expression and perhaps a hint of something unresolved or confusing that the therapist can explore further. A good example: “I feel so lost, like life has no purpose, and I don’t quite know which way to turn.” . This is a believable statement of confusion and despair. It’s straightforward in emotion (“lost,” “no purpose”), which allows the therapist to first empathize, but it also indicates a lack of direction, inviting exploration of what “lost” really feels like or where it comes from. Another marker: “My husband makes me so frustrated. Sometimes I just want to strangle him.” . The client clearly states anger (“so frustrated”) and even uses a violent figure of speech (“want to strangle him”). That hyperbole is a clue to strong emotion that might hide hurt or specific triggers – it’s a great opening for the therapist to explore what’s beneath the rage. These beginner markers are realistic (clients often vent in dramatic terms when upset) and they present a clear emotion as a starting point. Additionally, consider: “Both of my parents died last year. It is hard to bear.” . The client is stating grief in a muted way (“hard to bear”); there’s room for exploration of the depth of that sadness or how it’s affecting them, beyond the understatement. And “I just started dating a new guy… he’s awesome and super cute, but there is something about him that I question… I am not clear on what or why!” . Here the client is excited (“awesome guy”) yet has an undefined hesitation. This marker explicitly says “I am not clear on what or why,” essentially asking for help to explore those unclear feelings. Beginner markers for empathic exploration are often like this: the client gives an emotional situation and either directly or indirectly signals that they don’t fully understand it or feel conflicted. The language is plain, not too defensive or complicated, making it feasible to explore. They match beginner level because the therapist doesn’t have to decode heavy defenses or contradictions; the client is relatively open (e.g., openly saying “I feel horrible about losing my daughter for 10 minutes” – fear and guilt that are on the table ). These markers lay out one or two feelings clearly but have an unexplored aspect (the meaning, the bodily feeling, the reason behind it) that the therapist can help uncover.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

A therapist’s response at the beginner level of empathic exploration will first reflect or empathize with the client’s emotion and then include a gentle prompt for further exploration, often by focusing on feelings or by using evocative language that captures what might be just out of the client’s awareness. For example, responding to the “lost, no purpose” client, the therapist might say: “Just feeling so lost and without meaning, and there is a feeling of wanting to reach forward but not knowing how, somehow.” . In this response from the exercise, the therapist doesn’t ask a direct question but empathically expands on the client’s statement: they acknowledge the feeling of being lost and even add an exploration of the client’s longing (“wanting to reach forward but not knowing how”). The word “somehow” at the end suggests the therapist is trying to articulate the client’s inner struggle, inviting the client to confirm or elaborate. This is a hallmark of empathic exploration: sometimes the therapist offers a tentative guess or metaphor to deepen the understanding. Another instance: for the frustrated wife scenario, the therapist responds, “He just makes you so angry, maybe even enraged.” . This is primarily empathic reflection (“so angry”) but the addition of “maybe even enraged” is a slight exploration – testing if the anger is that intense. The therapist is checking if there’s even more emotion (which might open the door for the client to talk about why the anger is so strong). A response to the grieving client might be, “It feels so difficult and sad… almost an unbearable feeling.” . Here the therapist mirrors the client’s words (“difficult and sad”) and then carefully pushes the exploration by characterizing it as “almost unbearable,” putting words to what the client hinted (“hard to bear”). That encourages the client to acknowledge just how deep the pain goes (they might respond, “Yes, exactly, sometimes it is unbearable.”). For the excited-but-hesitant new relationship, the therapist says, “So, you are very excited and also, something makes you feel not sure.” . This straightforward response highlights the two sides (excitement vs. uncertainty) equally. It’s empathic (validating excitement) and exploratory (naming the vague doubt). The therapist isn’t solving it, but by simply stating “something makes you feel not sure,” they invite the client to consider what that “something” might be. All these responses share a strategy: acknowledge the known feeling, and introduce or amplify the not-yet-fully-expressed part in a gentle way. The tone is curious but not interrogative. The therapist might use reflective statements rather than direct questions – which can often feel more natural and less pressured for the client to continue exploring. The language remains simple and mirrors the client’s vocabulary (e.g., “lost,” “angry,” “sad,” “excited/not sure”). High-quality responses here model to trainees how to stay with the client’s experience (empathy) while nudging just a little deeper (exploration). They demonstrate that exploration at this stage can be as subtle as adding “somehow” or “maybe” or giving a slight metaphor (“reach forward but not knowing how”) rather than immediately asking “why” or “what does that mean?”. This keeps the conversation flowing and the client feeling understood, yet gently encouraged to go further.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate client statements for empathic exploration become a bit more guarded or complex, meaning the client might not explicitly state all their feelings or might present a scenario with some ambiguity. These markers require the therapist to tune in and pick up on undercurrents. For instance: “It was a difficult relationship. He treated me really badly. I really gave him everything, and he left me with nothing.” . The client expresses hurt and possibly shame (“treated me badly… left me with nothing”) but doesn’t outright say how they feel now, though we can infer sadness or feeling diminished. That’s an opening for exploration of emotional impact (perhaps shame or low self-worth). Another: “I really love my wife, but she has developed some strange behavioral habits. I am not sure what to do.” . Here the client shows love and discomfort (“strange habits”) but is vague about what the habits are or what he feels about them beyond uncertainty. The mixed positive and negative is a marker that invites exploring the feelings of discomfort or confusion in more detail. Another example: “My last therapist dropped me after I missed a session. It has left me feeling unsure about trusting any therapist. I mean, I am here today… but…” . The client explicitly mentions distrust (which is great – a clear feeling), but the trailing “but…” suggests residual hesitation. A high-quality marker here is that the client has one foot in the door and one out; they name the issue (trust) but also signal they might still be guarded. This is a scenario where empathic exploration can help them process that uncertainty and fear of being dropped again. Also: “I’m not very emotional and don’t really understand feelings. I am not sure what I am going to talk about.” . The client basically says “I don’t do feelings” – a challenge for therapy. It’s a marker because it’s likely covering some anxiety or maybe an emotional block that can be explored (e.g., what feelings are they uncomfortable with, where did they learn to not be emotional). Intermediate markers often have this quality: the client states a problem or fact, but the underlying feeling is somewhat implicit. They might downplay emotion or be circumspect about it. The therapist’s task is to empathically bring out the emotion or meaning hiding behind the statements. These markers are still plausible and often encountered in therapy (e.g., clients who say “I’m not emotional” are common). They fit intermediate difficulty since the client isn’t blatantly throwing their feelings out; the therapist needs to read into it slightly (without making leaps that feel forced).

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

For intermediate empathic exploration, therapist responses become a bit more pointed in highlighting the emotional content that’s lurking just beneath the client’s words, while still aligning closely with what the client has said. The therapist often uses reflections that make the implicit explicit, and may pose a gentle clarification question. For the client from a bad relationship who was left with nothing, a therapist might respond: “Just the way he treated you after you gave everything you could, it just left you feeling so down, so diminished.” . This response takes the client’s narrative (“gave him everything, left with nothing”) and draws out the implied emotions: feeling down and diminished. The therapist uses empathic language (“just the way… it just left you feeling…”) to confirm that emotional impact. It’s likely exactly what the client feels but hadn’t explicitly labeled. For the man with the wife’s strange habits, the therapist says: “So, you really love her and she has been doing some funny things that leave you feeling quite uncomfortable?” . This response validates both sides: the love and the discomfort, naming “uncomfortable” which the client hinted at with “not sure what to do.” It invites the client to elaborate on that discomfort. The phrase “some funny things” echoes the client’s own slightly minimizing language (“strange habits”) but pinpoints that it actually makes him uncomfortable emotionally. This encourages him to explore those feelings or the nature of the habits. For the dropped-by-therapist scenario, the response could be: “It sounds like it was quite a difficult experience with your last therapist, and you are feeling really unsure that you can open up and share with me?” . This is empathic and exploratory: it restates the trust issue as “really unsure about opening up with me,” which gently challenges the client to reflect on their current stance. It shows the therapist isn’t afraid to bring the here-and-now (possible hesitation in the current relationship) into the conversation, which is often needed to help the client voice and work through it. It’s delivered as a question tone (“unsure that you can…?”) to allow the client to agree or clarify. For the “not very emotional” client, the therapist might respond, “So, it is difficult for you to sort out what is even a feeling, and that leaves you unsure what it is you are going to talk about here… it’s like, ‘Where do I begin?’” . This response is spot-on: it validates the client’s difficulty (“difficult to sort out what is a feeling”) and directly echoes their worry about not knowing what to say, even voicing an internal monologue “Where do I begin?”. By doing this, the therapist empathically imagines the client’s confusion and almost gives them the words for it, which typically leads the client to feel understood and perhaps elaborate more about their blankness or confusion. These intermediate responses show a pattern: empathic elaboration plus gentle interpretation. The therapist is still phrasing things in a sympathetic way, often starting with “So…” or “It sounds like…” and ending with a question or a slight uptick in tone to invite correction. They frequently incorporate the client’s scenario details to ground the empathy (e.g., “after you gave everything, he left you with nothing” is transformed into “left you feeling so diminished”). The language remains accessible and not overly psychodynamic or analytical, yet it digs into the emotional reality. Trainees can learn from this how to listen for what’s unspoken and bring it into the dialogue in a supportive manner. The responses don’t shy away from stating a possible feeling the client hasn’t said (“diminished,” “uncomfortable,” “unsure you can open up”) – this is a bit of empathic inference – but they state it in a tentative or understanding way so the client can confirm or clarify. This is key in empathic exploration: you sometimes guess what the client might feel, but in a collaborative spirit. Good intermediate responses demonstrate this skill: they venture a bit beyond what’s said, but not so far as to be off-base, sticking closely to the client’s narrative and providing a clearer mirror of their inner state.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced client statements in empathic exploration scenarios are often those where the client is either in a highly defended state or experiencing something unusual/strong that they struggle to articulate. These markers typically require the therapist to engage in deep focusing or imaginative techniques to help the client make sense of their experience. One example: “I’m feeling strange right now… it’s all blurry and foggy inside… kind of warm, like a balloon floating away. Is this normal? Am I in danger?” . This marker is a client describing a dissociative or trance-like feeling. It’s advanced because the client is not describing a clear emotion like “sad” or “angry,” but rather a subjective internal state with sensory qualities (blurry, warm, floating) and anxiety about it (“am I in danger?”). The therapist will need to help the client explore this state without causing panic, likely by encouraging them to stay with it and describe it (if safe). Another advanced marker: “You seem like such a confident and healthy person, and I feel that in comparison, I’m a mess. I can’t understand how you could even want to help me. Why can’t I just be normal and healthy like you?” . Here, the client is projecting an ideal onto the therapist and denigrating themselves (“I’m a mess”), which indicates feelings of shame or inferiority. It’s a marker because the client is not explicitly saying “I feel ashamed,” but it’s evident; plus, they’re focusing on the therapist’s traits which might hint at a relational issue or transference. The therapist will need to explore the client’s feelings of inadequacy and the meaning of “normal.” Another advanced marker: “Is it okay if I’m attracted to you?” . That’s a direct but advanced scenario – the client is checking if a taboo feeling (attraction to therapist) can be admitted. It requires delicate exploration of boundaries and the feelings behind the attraction, likely fear of how the therapist will react. Also, “It is like I don’t know why I stay in the relationship… He does not prioritize me… I guess I feel I have to stay, but I don’t even understand it.” (from 8†L860-L868 somewhat paraphrased). This marker shows a client in a stuck pattern (staying with a partner who neglects them) and confessing confusion about their own motives. It’s advanced because the reasons might be unconscious or tied to deep fears of abandonment, etc. Lastly, “You’re asking me how I feel… If I tell you, you’re going to want to hospitalize me… so I’m fine.” . This is a client who is guarded due to previous consequences (perhaps they have had hospitalizations). It’s a marker that they are terrified of expressing certain feelings (likely suicidal or homicidal ideation) – which is advanced content to handle. In summary, advanced markers for empathic exploration often involve either dissociative experiences, significant transference issues, taboo or boundary-testing content, or deep ambivalence/contradiction in the client’s behavior or self-view. They are more challenging because the client isn’t simply saying “I feel X,” they might be saying “I don’t feel or I feel something odd or I shouldn’t feel this.” These require the therapist to carefully focus the client inward or address the interpersonal context to get to the heart of the matter.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

Advanced empathic exploration responses often employ more explicitly focusing-oriented or experiential techniques, sometimes even referencing them in words. The therapist must maintain empathy while guiding the client to explore precarious inner territory. For the dissociative “floating” client, a high-quality response might be: “It sounds like a scary feeling, and I don’t think you are in danger, but just feeling so strange, and kind of blurry, as if you are floating, and it leaves you wondering if you are normal. [Pauses] It sounds hard, but can we stay with that feeling a little longer?” . This response is drawn from the text and shows how the therapist first validates and normalizes (“I don’t think you are in danger” – addressing the client’s fear) and reflects the experience in the client’s own imagery (“blurry, floating, wondering if normal”). Then the therapist gently invites the client to stay with the feeling. This is a direct focusing instruction disguised in a very caring tone. The therapist even uses a little reassurance to keep the client grounded, then uses curiosity (“can we stay with it?”) to encourage exploration. That’s a sophisticated balance of empathy and exploration necessary for dissociative states. For the client comparing themselves negatively to the therapist (“I’m a mess, you’re confident”), an advanced response might be: “So, to you it seems like I have it all together. But for you it feels like you are struggling so much. I want to reassure you that I do want to find a way to help you. So, you want to feel alright inside, but it feels like you are just in a mess.” . In this actual response from the text, the therapist first reflects the client’s perception (“I seem confident to you, you feel like a mess”) – showing empathy for their viewpoint – and then offers reassurance of commitment (“I do want to help you”). It’s both exploratory and affirmative: it surfaces the client’s shame and seeks to comfort it. The therapist might follow this up by exploring where that feeling of being a mess comes from, or how it feels. But the initial response already helps by acknowledging and not dismissing the comparison, yet reframing it as something they’ll work on (“find a way to help you”). For the client asking if it’s okay to be attracted to the therapist, the response in the text is: “So, you wonder if feeling attracted to me is okay and how I will react… I’m flattered, and I’m pleased you are telling me, and maybe you could say more about your fears?” . This is an excellent advanced exploration response. The therapist keeps a neutral, accepting stance (“I’m flattered and glad you told me”) – which defuses the taboo – and immediately shifts to exploring the fears behind the question (“maybe say more about your fears”). It empathizes that the client is likely afraid of the therapist’s reaction. By inviting the client to elaborate on those fears, the therapist is exploring the meaning of the attraction or the client’s worry about it, rather than focusing on the attraction content inappropriately. This models comfort with difficult topics and keeps the focus on the client’s experience (their fear of judgment or rejection), which can be very therapeutic. For the ambivalent relationship client (“don’t know why I stay”), a therapist might first reflect the conflict: “Somehow you want to leave, but you cannot. I imagine that it’s like a feeling of, ‘I am so afraid.’” . This from exercise 8’s conjectures section shows a therapist empathically guessing fear underneath being trapped. In an explorative stance, the therapist might then gently ask, “What do you feel when you think about leaving? What are you most afraid would happen?” – thus directing the client to explore that fear or the attachment need. For the guarded client fearing hospitalization, a good approach is to acknowledge their caution explicitly and create safety. The therapist could respond: “You’re very cautious about sharing how you really feel, and I get that – it sounds like you had a frightening experience in the past when you got very upset. Maybe we can talk about what happened then and what you’re worried might happen now. I want you to know we can go very slowly and that just because you feel something doesn’t mean I’ll jump to any extreme actions. What do you think?” This kind of response is not from the text, but it follows the principles of advanced empathic exploration: validate the client’s protective stance, explore the past incident and current fear (in a collaborative way), and reassure about the process (going slowly, not hospitalizing for mere expression of feelings, unless absolutely necessary). The therapist is essentially exploring the meta-conversation (fear of what therapy might do) as well as the feelings the client might be holding back. It’s advanced because the therapist needs to manage safety concerns and build trust simultaneously. Across these advanced responses, we see that the therapist’s role is often to make the implicit explicit – whether it’s the fear beneath a question, the shame in a comparison, or the hidden meaning of a dissociative feeling – while also maintaining or even increasing the client’s sense of safety in the conversation. Techniques like pausing, asking permission (“can we stay with it?”), and explicitly stating acceptance (“I’m flattered you told me”) are utilized. The language remains mostly simple but may incorporate some of the client’s descriptive imagery or exact words to anchor the exploration (e.g., “ringing in your ears… ‘only weak people feel…’” was used in exercise 7 advanced to evoke the internalized voice , inviting the client to explore how that belief feels). High-quality advanced exploration responses show great attunement: they respect the client’s defenses (not bulldozing them) yet gently penetrate them by focusing attention or asking about the feelings behind them. They serve as excellent models for trainees on how to go deeper with a client’s experience without sacrificing empathy or the client’s sense of control.

## Exercise 7: Empathic Evocations

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

At the beginner level for empathic evocations, client statements often contain clear emotional content with imagery or metaphoric potential that the therapist can amplify or reflect in a vivid way. These markers are usually straightforward expressions of feeling, but a skilled therapist can deepen the emotional resonance by using the client’s own descriptive language or adding a metaphor. For example: “You should have seen how she glared at me. It made me feel so little.” . The client already uses an image (“glared at me”) and a metaphor (“so little”). This is ripe for an evocative response that might extend “feeling little” into a more vivid metaphor of invisibility or shrinking. Another example: “I feel so taken advantage of by her, so used.” . The phrase “so used” can be expanded into something like feeling like an object or toy – giving an imaginative entry point. A third: “He just put down the phone in the middle of our conversation. I was so hurt.”  (though from exercise 4, similar content appears in 7 with an anger twist). The therapist might evoke how that hurt felt (maybe like a slap or like the floor dropping out). Another beginner marker: “My son is dating this new girl who is so disrespectful. She really makes my blood boil. Just furious!”  (again from 4, but mirrored in 7). Here the client’s language “makes my blood boil” is already an idiom evoking heat and explosion – a perfect handle for further evocation (like “ready to explode” or “like a pot boiling over”). And: “I’ve been making a list of all people I’ve disappointed and hurt due to my drinking. There are so many, I don’t know if I can handle it.” . The list itself is an image (a possibly endless list), and the despair (“so many”) could be evoked as feeling swamped or drowning. Beginner markers for evocative empathy typically present a clear emotional reaction (hurt, anger, shame, etc.) and often casual imagery in their wording that can be leveraged (like “blood boil,” “feel so little”). They match the beginner skill level because the emotions are directly stated, so the therapist doesn’t have to dig for “what’s going on,” they only have to embellish or illustrate it empathically. The client’s language is everyday but often contains a seed of imagery or a sensory description that can be expanded upon.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

A strong beginner-level empathic evocation response takes what the client has given – the emotion and any imagery – and plays it back with heightened vividness, often using similes or metaphors that resonate with the client’s experience. The therapist’s tone is empathic but also a bit more expressive than a plain reflection, showing they are emotionally attuned. For the glare example (“felt so little”), a therapist might respond: “Yeah, just so small, almost as if you weren’t there, you could just disappear.” . This actual response uses the client’s “so little” and deepens it: “almost as if you weren’t there, you could just disappear.” It captures the essence of feeling small (feeling invisible or wanting to vanish from shame). The empathic tone (“Yeah, just so small”) validates, and the metaphor (“could just disappear”) evokes the intensity of the emotion. For “so used,” the text gives: “You feel kind of jerked around, like a yo-yo.” . This is a classic evocative empathy move: turning “used” into a concrete image – a yo-yo being jerked around, implying the client feels toyed with and up-and-down. It’s simple language but it paints a picture. For the hurt phone-hangup client, a therapist could say: “It’s like you were abruptly cut off – like a door slammed in your face mid-conversation – leaving you stunned and hurt.” (Not from text directly, but an example of how to evoke that feeling of hurt and shock.) In the provided material, we have “Just the sight of her makes you want to blow up!”  for the angry mother about son’s girlfriend. This takes “blood boil” and “furious” and condenses it to the explosive image “want to blow up.” It communicates the client’s anger in a visceral way that matches how intense it is. Another from the text: “Something about her accusing you of having a drinking problem feels like a knife digging into you.” , said to the man upset that his wife calls him an alcoholic. This response uses a violent metaphor (“a knife digging into you”) to evoke the pain and sense of injustice he feels – far more graphic than just “very upsetting,” it viscerally captures the sting of that accusation. And for the long list of people hurt by drinking: “Like a list a mile wide. It is as if you lose count, with so much sorrow. It is like, ‘Where do I begin?’” . Here the therapist picks up the “list” and exaggerates it to “a mile wide” – conveying enormity – and imagines the client’s overwhelmed mind (“lose count… where do I begin?”). This is empathic and vivid; it uses a bit of the client’s own expression (“so many”) and transforms it into a more visual, experiential description of being overwhelmed by guilt. All these responses illustrate how, at the beginner level, therapists can effectively use everyday metaphors or physical analogies to dramatize the client’s internal experience in a way that feels empathic (the client often responds like “Yes! Exactly, that’s how it feels.”). The key to a high-quality response is that it remains congruent with the client’s actual feeling – you don’t introduce a random image that doesn’t fit. Instead, you take cues from the client’s narrative (e.g., movement for “jerked around,” heat for “blood boil,” sharp pain for accusation) and amplify them. The language is not clinical at all – it’s imaginative and relatable. Trainees can learn from these examples to be creative in their empathy, not just saying “you’re very upset,” but perhaps “it’s like you’re being pulled in every direction and it’s tearing at you.” It makes the empathy more palpable. Moreover, note the therapist sometimes even acts out a bit, as indicated by stage directions in text like [therapist slumps down in their chair, blows out air] for the accordion/“fold up” metaphor . That shows how a therapist might physically embody the metaphor (slumping like an accordion closing) to communicate empathy. While that might be more advanced, it is still part of empathic evocation – using non-verbal expression too. Overall, high-quality beginner evocations are bold enough to capture the feeling, but grounded enough in the client’s experience that they resonate strongly. The client feels deeply understood because the therapist is speaking in rich, image-based language that matches the client’s inner sensation or emotional reality, even if the client themselves didn’t articulate it that way initially.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate markers for empathic evocation involve clients expressing emotions that are perhaps a bit more nuanced or conflicted than the beginner ones, giving the therapist material to create multi-layered imagery. These statements often contain hints of metaphor or strong feeling, but maybe spread across a few sentences, requiring the therapist to synthesize them into a concise evocative image. For instance: “I love him so much that it’s hard to think of anything else.” . This expresses an almost obsessive love – the therapist could evoke this as being “smitten” or the world narrowing to just him. In fact, the response given is “You are so smitten, he has really rocked your world—just feels like nothing else matters.”  which uses “smitten” and “rocked your world” to capture that obsession. Another example: “I just feel so worthless.”  – it’s stark, but the therapist can evoke the qualitative sense of worthlessness. The given response is “It is like ‘I feel like such a nothing,’ like ‘I don’t deserve to exist,’ like wanting to shrink into the floor.” , which takes “worthless” and translates it into the client’s inner voice (“I’m nothing”), existential negation (“don’t deserve to exist”), and a physical impulse (“shrink into the floor”). The original marker is very short, but clearly an intermediate-level despair that can be vividly expanded. Another marker: “My boyfriend has been so unfaithful… I just can’t let myself love him anymore… I need to stop loving him.” . This has betrayal, heartbreak, and resolve – the therapist might empathize with the heartbreak and boundary. The response: “Somehow you feel so betrayed, so taken advantage of, and it is a feeling of ‘This is where I draw the line!’” , uses an evocative phrase “draw the line” (signaling finality) to capture her determination and hurt. Next: “I love my girlfriend a lot… She’s always there for me, no matter what I do. I can even sleep with other girls! She’s like the perfect girlfriend.” , the client is describing a relationship with no boundaries, seemingly ideal but perhaps with an undertone that something’s off (he sounds almost bemused he can cheat without consequence). The therapist’s evocative response: “Somehow it feels like the most perfect relationship. It’s as if there are no boundaries, no walls to bump up against.” . This elegantly picks up “perfect girlfriend” and paints the image of no boundaries/walls, implicitly highlighting the peculiarity of that situation. It resonates with the client’s almost surreal freedom in the relationship. Another intermediate marker: “when he starts talking, I feel like I cannot get a word in, and eventually I just give up and shut down.”  (similar to earlier exercises). The therapist’s response: “Yes, it is as if you just fold up like an accordion… kind of like ‘What is the point, why bother?’”  (with therapist slumping physically). Here the client described shutting down; the therapist evokes it as physically folding up and sighing out “why bother.” It’s a powerful visual of collapse. And “I just wish my father would acknowledge my feelings… When he doesn’t, it leaves me with a strong, empty, churning feeling in my stomach.” . The client already gives an internal sensation “churning in my stomach.” The therapist can emphasize that: “When you imagine him turning away from you, you feel a churning, buzzy feeling in the pit of your stomach.” . They use onomatopoeic “buzzy” to enhance “churning,” making it even more sensory. The marker provided the sensory detail; the therapist affirms it and maybe intensifies it slightly by describing it vividly. These intermediate markers are clearly emotional, but the therapist’s evocations give them extra texture: whether by voicing inner thoughts (worthlessness, hopelessness), introducing metaphors (rocked your world, shrink into floor), or highlighting physical sensations (folding, buzzing). They suit intermediate level since the emotions are a bit deeper (obsessive love, profound worthlessness, betrayal, etc.), and the therapist’s images might combine multiple aspects (pain and resolve, love and danger of no boundaries, etc.). Clients at this level resonate with these reflections because they capture contradictions or profound feelings succinctly.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

The intermediate-level evocative responses often weave together multiple elements of the client’s feelings into one or two potent images or analogies, as seen above. They also may incorporate a performative element (like slumping, or using tone of voice changes when quoting the client’s inner dialogue). The therapist clearly demonstrates the skill by making the feeling nearly tangible. For instance, in “You are so smitten, he has really rocked your world—just feels like nothing else matters.” , the therapist uses a bit of slightly colloquial language (“smitten,” “rocked your world”) that actually intensifies the empathy – it’s casual but very expressive. It suggests the overwhelming nature of love the client is in. Similarly, “It is like ‘I feel like such a nothing,’… like wanting to shrink into the floor.”  – the therapist here put themselves into the client’s perspective (“I feel like such a nothing”) and even further to a vivid action (shrinking). Speaking in first person as the client (“I feel so X”) is a known technique to convey deep empathy. The effect is that the client hears their unspoken thoughts articulated, which can be cathartic. For the betrayal: “… feeling of ‘This is where I draw the line!’” , the therapist encapsulates a complex emotional boundary in one strong phrase, presumably echoing the client’s determination. Possibly the therapist even used a firm tone there, matching the resolve. In “no boundaries, no walls to bump up against” , the double negative structure evokes the limitless nature of the relationship, giving a slight feeling of danger or unreality in something that’s “too perfect.” It encourages the client to reflect on whether that truly feels good or maybe unsettling (without directly stating it’s an issue – just evoking the sensation of “no walls”). The accordion example “fold up like an accordion… ‘What is the point?’”  is wonderfully dramatic and empathic – any client who tends to shut down will likely feel seen by that exact depiction (the posture, the sigh). And the “churning, buzzy in pit of stomach”  response picks up and amplifies the physical symptom the client already provided. This shows the therapist is really with the client’s felt sense, and by articulating it with rich adjectives, it can help the client become more aware of that feeling and perhaps express emotion about it. For trainees, these intermediate responses are instructive: they can see that effective evocative empathy means sometimes taking a risk to use colorful language or to embody the client’s experience in words or small gestures. The responses are not meandering – they’re often one or two sentences, delivered confidently. Each image or phrase is chosen to resonate with a particular facet of the experience. Notice also the use of repetition or multiple similes in a row (like “It is like …, like …, like …” in the worthlessness response ) – this technique bombards the client with two or three related images, which can really drive home the recognition (if one metaphor doesn’t hit, the next might). It also conveys just how big or all-encompassing the feeling is (the therapist can’t capture it in just one image, so they use several). The language remains relatable, often borrowing from common expressions (“draw the line,” “nothing else matters,” “why bother?”). This ensures the response doesn’t confuse the client but rather strikes a chord. In summary, intermediate evocative responses clearly show the target skill: the therapist is painting the client’s emotional picture in high-definition, so that the client themselves can see it more clearly and feel truly understood at a gut level.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced client markers for empathic evocation are often complex and intense emotional statements where the client might be holding back or using intellectualization, or the content is heavy and requires strong imagery to fully empathize with. These markers provide fertile ground for deep, sometimes imaginative metaphors. For example: “Everything is perfect. I felt suicidal last week when my girlfriend left. But yesterday she came back… Maybe we should stop therapy?” . The client is in denial/minimization after a serious crisis – “everything’s perfect now.” The underlying wound (suicidal despair) is papered over. A therapist could evoke the unacknowledged pain: indeed the provided response is “When things feel okay, it feels like you have been able to stop the bleeding, but I guess the wounds underneath run really deep.” . This metaphor (stopping bleeding vs. deep wounds) expertly captures how the surface is patched but the deep injury remains. Another advanced marker: “I am in such a confused, distressed place… I don’t even know what I feel or where to begin.” . The client is overwhelmed. The therapist’s response: “So, just tangled up as if you are stuck in the mud… not even knowing what door to open next.”  evokes confusion as being tangled and stuck, and the uncertainty as being faced with many doors, not sure which one. Two metaphors in one – both convey being immobilized and lost. Another: “My father was in the army, and he taught me that only weak people have feelings.” . The client states a belief stunting his emotional expression. The therapist’s evocative entry in text is “So, you just hear your father’s words ringing in your ears… ‘only weak people feel…’” . This invites the client to vividly hear that internalized voice (the ellipsis suggests the therapist left the phrase hanging, which can emotionally resonate as an unfinished oppressive thought). The next line could be exploring how that feels inside. Another advanced marker: “I feel like nobody really knows I feel this, but deep inside there is really something wrong with me, like I am rotten to the core.”  (from exercise 4 advanced). The client even uses a metaphor “rotten to the core.” The therapist can latch onto that. The provided advanced response in exercise 7 uses a similar metaphor for a different context: “It is as if you have this beautiful linen cloth, but somehow there is a dark stain spreading across it, and try as you might, you cannot get rid of it, you cannot purify it.” . This was used in empathic evocation for shame (“rotten” equivalent) – the therapist turned “rotten core” into an image of a spreading dark stain on a pure cloth, an elegant metaphor for pervasive shame or perceived defect. It’s striking and poetic, fitting an advanced scenario where the client’s sense of defectiveness is profound. Another advanced marker: “If you betray me, I’m going to report you… ” . The client is intensely distrustful, possibly due to past trauma. The therapist might evoke the depth of that hurt, but the text’s given response to a betrayal theme (in a different exercise context) is: “It sounds like you have been really hurt before, and the wound of betrayal cuts really deep.” . This response uses a wound metaphor for betrayal – straightforward yet powerful, implying lasting pain. All these markers are heavy: suicidal ideation, confusion, macho conditioning, core shame, and intense distrust. They match advanced difficulty because the therapist must respond to strong defenses or deep pain with equally strong empathy that can break through. They often require layered or very poignant metaphors to meet the emotional intensity. The client might not explicitly state how devastated or confused or ashamed they are – or they state it intellectually (“rotten to the core”) – but a resonant image from the therapist can unlock those feelings.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

Advanced evocative responses are often the most creative and deeply felt. The therapist likely uses rich, sometimes multi-part imagery, or culturally resonant metaphors to capture the client’s experience. They also often include acknowledgment of depth or severity (words like “really deep,” “run really deep”). The “stop the bleeding vs wounds” response  for the denial example is brilliant: it acknowledges the client has managed to stabilize (“stop the bleeding”) yet implies that the underlying trauma (“wounds”) is still there and significant. This helps the client see the incongruence between “everything’s perfect” and what they went through. It’s empathic because it doesn’t call them a liar about being okay; it suggests maybe they put a bandage on something big. For confusion, “tangled up… stuck in the mud… not knowing what door to open”  – each piece of that paints the hopelessness and disorientation (tangled = chaotic emotions, mud = slow, heavy depression, many doors = choices with uncertainty). The therapist here used two distinct images (“tangled in mud” and “not knowing what door”) in one sentence – that’s advanced technique, layering metaphors, which can evoke the multifaceted nature of emotional experience. For the “weak people have feelings” client, the therapist not only echoed the internal voice (which itself is evocative – “ringing in your ears” suggests he can never escape hearing that), but might follow with an empathy like, “It’s like a command that keeps you from sharing anything at all, like a strict officer in your head.” (Just hypothesizing beyond the provided snippet). Actually, the exercise might leave it at hearing father’s words; sometimes just evoking that voice is enough for the client to react emotionally (anger or sadness). The “linen cloth with dark stain” metaphor  is very vivid and somewhat poetic, apt for a client feeling fundamentally stained or corrupted. It’s not a cliché; it’s a novel image, which can be very impactful. The therapist describes the client’s futile attempts to clean it (“try as you might, you cannot get rid of it”), which shows deep empathy for their struggle with shame. That likely resonates strongly – the client feels the therapist grasps how indelible and spreading their shame feels. For the betrayal/distrust, “wound of betrayal cuts really deep”  uses a straightforward but strong image (betrayal as a wound that “cuts” – implying knife-like trauma) and emphasizes depth, validating that their distrust has deep roots in hurt. Advanced responses frequently use words like “bleeding,” “wound,” “stain,” which are visceral. They might reference concepts like purification (which in the shame response ties into feeling morally dirty – something a client might subconsciously relate to even if they didn’t say it). They evoke senses: visual (dark stain), tactile (stuck in mud), auditory (“ringing in your ears”), etc. This multi-sensory engagement in language can stir feelings in the client that logical discussion wouldn’t. It’s also noteworthy that advanced evocative empathy might sometimes incorporate cautionary or serious tone if needed (like acknowledging suicidal talk not as just a phrase but something indicating deep wounds – while also mindful of risk management outside of the empathy moment, as footnotes in text indicate ). Trainees studying these advanced examples learn that as the emotional stakes rise, the therapist’s empathy should become even more concrete and resonant. It’s not enough to say “you’re very, very sad” – instead something like “it’s like you’re carrying a massive weight on your chest every day from this sadness” could be more effective. The responses show the therapist’s courage to join the client in their darkest places with clear-eyed compassion. They don’t shy away from words like “suicidal” or “betrayal” or “ashamed” – instead they weave them into imagery that validates the enormity of the client’s feelings. The effect is that the client feels profoundly understood – possibly more than they could articulate themselves. That can foster catharsis or at least a sense of not being alone in their experience.

## Exercise 8: Empathic Conjectures

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Beginner client statements suited for empathic conjectures are those where the client expresses a feeling or situation but perhaps not all underlying feelings are explicit. The therapist can make a gentle guess about an additional feeling that might be present. The markers often clearly show one emotion while hinting at another. For example: “You should have seen how she glared at me. It made me feel so little.” . The client says they felt small (shame), but a therapist might conjecture there’s anger too (being glared at can also provoke anger). In fact, the therapist responds: “I imagine just burning with anger, and also… feeling diminished and hurt.” , adding anger to the mix of hurt. Another: “I feel so taken advantage of by her, so used.” . The client explicitly says they feel used (betrayal/anger), and the therapist guesses additional feelings: “I guess you feel so used, and, I don’t know, maybe even outraged… resentful and… hurt inside.” . The client didn’t say “outraged” or “hurt,” but those are plausible given feeling used. The “I don’t know, maybe” phrasing marks it as a conjecture, not a fact. Third: “I really hate it when my wife says I have a drinking problem… She smokes a lot of dope!” . The client expresses anger (“hate it”) and injustice (“one to accuse!”). The therapist conjectures: “So, you get so angry… it feels so unfair, but I guess you feel criticized and unfairly treated.” . The guess “you feel criticized and unfairly treated” articulates something the client implied but didn’t articulate (the hurt/pride aspect). Another marker: “My son is dating this new girl who is so disrespectful. She really makes my blood boil.” . The therapist might guess beneath the anger, maybe that the client feels rejected or powerless. They respond: “The way she treats you makes you so angry, and I guess you just feel rejected!” . That adds an underlying hurt (rejection) to the open anger. Finally, “I’ve been making a list of all people I’ve disappointed… so many, I don’t know if I can handle it.” . The client voices overwhelm and guilt. Therapist can conjecture vulnerability: “Something about having to apologize I imagine leaves you feeling so vulnerable, almost unprotected.” . Here the therapist inserts “vulnerable, unprotected” – feelings the client didn’t say but likely experiences. These markers are high-quality for conjecture because each clearly presents at least one surface emotion (anger, shame, guilt, etc.), giving the therapist a solid starting point to infer another layer. They are straightforward scenarios, so a beginner therapist can reasonably guess an adjacent emotion (e.g., hurt often accompanies anger, vulnerability accompanies guilt). The language from clients is still natural and not overly convoluted, so the empathic guess can also be simply phrased.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

In beginner empathic conjectures, the therapist usually employs tentative language (“I imagine…”, “I guess…”, “maybe…”) to add an emotional hypothesis. The response includes what the client explicitly said plus the guessed feeling, thereby not neglecting the client’s own words. For instance: “I imagine just burning with anger, and also… feeling diminished and hurt.”  first acknowledges potential anger (“burning with anger” – a vivid way to concur with feeling offended by glare) and then adds “diminished and hurt” which is what the client did say (“so little” basically means diminished and hurt). Actually in this one, the client did say feeling little – the therapist imagines anger in addition. So the structure can be either adding a new emotion or reinforcing an implied one. Another: “I guess you feel so used, and, I don’t know, maybe even outraged… resentful and I imagine feeling taken for granted, and hurt inside.” . This response is full of hedge words (“I guess… I don’t know, maybe… I imagine…”) which soften the conjectures. It then lists several feelings: outraged, resentful, taken for granted, hurt. The client said “taken advantage of/used” (implying resentment perhaps), the therapist piles on synonyms and deeper feelings like hurt. Importantly, by saying “I don’t know, maybe outraged,” the therapist invites correction if wrong and signals humility. For the drinking accusation: “So, you get so angry… it feels so unfair, but I guess you feel criticized and unfairly treated.” . The therapist starts with empathy for anger (which the client voiced: “hate it”), adds “feels so unfair” to validate injustice, then guesses at the underbelly: “criticized and unfairly treated.” It’s likely accurate because being accused often makes one feel judged. The phrase “I guess” makes it a mild conjecture. For the disrespectful girlfriend: “The way she treats you makes you so angry, and I guess you just feel rejected!” . This has “I guess” and an exclamation, perhaps mirroring the client’s intensity. The guess “rejected” transforms the client’s boiling anger into a more vulnerable feeling. It’s a one-word conjecture but a powerful reframe from anger to hurt. For the apology list: “Something about having to apologize I imagine leaves you feeling so vulnerable, almost unprotected.” . The therapist picks up on “don’t know if I can handle it” (fear, overwhelm) and the nature of apologies (exposing oneself) and guesses “vulnerable, unprotected.” They say “I imagine” to keep it conjectural. Throughout these responses, we see a pattern: acknowledge the stated feeling -> introduce a tentative guess of another feeling (often a softer one). The tone is caring and not assertive. These responses model to trainees how to extend empathy beyond what’s given, without steamrolling the client. The language is carefully chosen to be not too certain. Even the structure “and, I don’t know, maybe even X”  shows deliberate uncertainty which is appropriate. Yet, the feelings chosen are very plausible, drawn from general emotional theory (e.g., anger often covers hurt; guilt can come with vulnerability; being used likely evokes outrage as well as hurt). The therapist is essentially articulating the emotional subtext in a gentle way. When done well, the client will typically respond with relief or clarification (like “Yeah, I do feel hurt too,” or “I don’t know about outraged, but it definitely made me resentful”). This moves the dialogue forward. The beginner level is about making one-step inferences, not too deep or abstract. The therapists stick to everyday feelings—nothing esoteric. This ensures the conjectures are understandable and likely correct, or at least in the ballpark. The high-quality nature is seen in how these responses deepen the conversation, bringing out richer emotional content than the client initially shared, while still making the client feel understood rather than misinterpreted.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate empathic conjecture markers involve clients who share more content, maybe multiple feelings or a situation without recognizing an emotion that’s implied. The therapist can infer an underlying emotional need or conflict. For example: “I love him so much that it’s hard to think of anything else.”  from earlier. Client shows obsessive love, maybe underlying longing or dependency. The therapist conjectures: “So, caught up in this incredible feeling of love, and I guess this is touching a strong longing in you that you have been thirsting for.” . The client didn’t say “I have a strong longing” – the therapist inferred that her intensity signals a deep unmet need (“thirsting for”). That’s intermediate because it connects her current love to a broader need. Another: “Sometimes I just don’t like myself.” (in text: “Sometimes I just don’t like myself.” ). The therapist’s conjecture: “There is a strong feeling of ‘I feel so inadequate, so bad about me.’” . The client said “don’t like myself” which implies inadequacy; therapist basically reframes it in first-person and intensifies it (“so bad about me”). It’s slight but acknowledges the strength of self-dislike. Next: “My boyfriend cheated on me again… I need to stop loving him.” . She’s angry/betrayed, but likely deeply hurt and questioning why she still loves him. Therapist says: “You feel so betrayed and angry. And I imagine that also leaves you feeling so rejected, with a feeling of ‘Why can’t he love me?’” . This excellent conjecture not only adds “rejected” but even voices her inner question “Why can’t he love me?” She didn’t say that, but it’s a very plausible painful thought. It moves from her conscious anger to her deeper hurt/insecurity. Another marker: “I love my girlfriend… she lets me do anything (even cheat)… I don’t know why I want to distance myself from her.” . This hints he’s uncomfortable with the situation. The therapist conjectures: “On the one hand, it feels so perfect, and yet something feels uncomfortable, I imagine almost unnerving and you just want to push her away.” . So the client said “I don’t know why I want to distance myself,” therapist suggests it’s because it’s “unnerving” to have no limits, adding that nuance of discomfort, and acknowledges both sides (perfect vs. uncomfortable). This gives the client a possible explanation for his impulse to distance: perhaps the absolute acceptance feels unsettling. These intermediate markers often present two sides or incomplete insight, letting the therapist fill in an emotional logic. They match intermediate because the therapist’s guess ties feelings to each other or to needs. The client’s language in these cases is still accessible; they just haven’t dug deeper. The therapist’s role is to articulate the deeper layer that the client might sense but hasn’t put into words (like thirsting longing behind obsessive love, self-hate behind “don’t like myself”, fear of not being loved behind anger at cheating, discomfort behind “perfect” relationship).

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

The intermediate responses often combine empathy and conjecture seamlessly: they acknowledge what the client has said and then extend it to what is unsaid, all in one flow. For instance, “caught up in this incredible feeling of love” (empathizing with her statement of love) “and I guess this is touching a strong longing in you that you have been thirsting for.”  – here, “touching a strong longing you’ve been thirsting for” is the conjecture that her intensity is fueled by a long-standing emotional thirst. The use of “thirsting” is evocative and indicates how great that longing is. It’s likely correct if she’s intensely in love perhaps to fill a void. This shows a move from specific scenario to client’s emotional history or needs. For self-dislike: “strong feeling of ‘I feel so inadequate’…”  – the therapist basically rephrases “don’t like myself” to the more emotional “I feel so inadequate/so bad about me,” showing empathy and perhaps encouraging the client to elaborate what feels inadequate. They prefaced it with “There is a strong feeling of” which flags it as an empathic inference (maybe the client hadn’t framed it as a feeling but just a statement). For the cheated girlfriend: “You feel so betrayed and angry.” (validating what she likely feels) “And I imagine that also leaves you feeling so rejected, with a feeling of ‘Why can’t he love me?’” . This response is powerful – it names “rejected” (the vulnerable feeling) and directly voices the inner hurt (not feeling loved by him). The phrasing “I imagine” again keeps it gentle. Very likely a client in that scenario would say “Exactly – I keep asking why I’m not enough?” or even if not, it surfaces that wound to discuss. It’s intermediate as it connects the dots from betrayal to core self-worth pain. For the guy with permissive girlfriend: “On one hand… on the other hand” structure is used . This acknowledges his mixed feelings (he’s partly in awe of her perfection, partly uneasy). The therapist adds names to the uneasy feelings: “uncomfortable, almost unnerving” (really insightful – because limitless freedom in a relationship can indeed be eerie). They guess he “wants to push her away.” Actually he said he wants to distance but doesn’t know why – the therapist validates he does want to push away and suggests a reason (unnerving feeling). This likely helps the client see, “Yes, it does freak me out that she has no boundaries or self-respect in this.” The therapist still uses “I imagine” to frame it as a hypothesis. Common elements in these responses: using first person voice for client’s inner statements (“Why can’t he love me?” or “I feel so inadequate”) which makes the empathy more immediate; using contrasting connectors (“on the one hand… on the other hand”) to capture ambivalence; and descriptive words for feelings that client hasn’t explicitly labeled (longing, inadequate, rejected, uncomfortable). The tone is confident yet gentle. It’s as if the therapist is stepping just a little ahead of where the client is, and then looking back to see if the client follows. If done right, the client will often say “I guess that’s true” or clarify, which deepens the session. For trainees, these intermediate examples show how to integrate what’s spoken and unspoken in one response, and how to use “I imagine/I guess” to keep conjectures collaborative rather than imposing. They also show the therapist reaching into attachment themes: longing for love, fear of not being loved, discomfort with too much closeness – which are deeper than the surface events. That’s a hallmark of intermediate empathy: not just feeling-of-the-moment, but how the moment taps into larger emotional patterns.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced markers for empathic conjecture include clients expressing something that is likely masking or related to even deeper emotions or conflicts, often ones tied to personal identity or major life dilemmas. The therapist must use a very nuanced guess to illuminate what might be going on internally. One advanced scenario: “When my boyfriend starts talking, I feel like I cannot get a word in… I find myself just giving up and shut down.”  (similar to prior, but at advanced maybe minimal expression of frustration). Therapist might guess a hidden anger: “So you kind of give up and shut down but you actually feel so intruded upon and maybe angry inside…” . Which they did in exercise 8 response 1. The client said nothing about anger or intruded, they just said they withdraw. The therapist infers that even though she appears to surrender, internally she likely feels violated or resentful (“intruded upon, angry”). That’s advanced because it’s not obvious from her statement – it takes understanding of common responses to being talked over (anger that one suppresses). Another: “I don’t know why I don’t just leave the relationship. I think it is self-destructive, but somehow I can’t leave.” . The client intellectually knows they should leave, but feels unable – likely due to fear or attachment. Therapist says: “Somehow you want to leave, but you cannot. I imagine that it’s like a feeling of ‘I am so afraid.’” . They insert “I am so afraid” to name the fear gluing the client there, which the client didn’t mention. That’s a deeper emotional truth (fear of loneliness or change, etc.). Another: “Everything is perfect. I felt suicidal when she left but now she came back… Maybe we should stop therapy.” (denial scenario) The therapist’s conjecture was in Ex 8: “I guess it feels okay now, but it sounds like this is touching something very deep inside for you, and it’s making it hard to feel like you want to keep going.” . The client says “we can stop,” but the therapist guesses the quick fix is touching deeper unresolved issues making therapy feel threatening (hitting “something very deep” making him not want to continue). It’s subtle: the therapist gently flags that the return of girlfriend triggered a deep vulnerability that perhaps he doesn’t want to face (hence wanting to quit therapy). Another advanced marker: “I am in such a confused place… I don’t know what I feel or where to begin.” Therapist conjecture in Ex 8: “Just not knowing where to begin, I guess it is somehow scary to approach your feelings…” . The client only said confusion, no mention of fear; therapist infers that behind not knowing is fear of digging in. And “My father taught me feelings are weak.” The client might not admit feeling anything about this, but the therapist in Ex 8 guess: “So, your father taught you to feel is to be weak. That must leave you feeling very confusing and difficult, and could perhaps leave you feeling angry?” . The therapist guesses the client is confused and maybe angry about the conflict between what he feels and that message. The client didn’t say he’s confused or angry – he might have just repeated the belief. The therapist hypothesizes an internal struggle (confusion/difficulty) and maybe anger at that message or at self for feeling (which is advanced because the client might not even be conscious of anger at father’s teaching yet). Advanced markers often deal with internal conflicts or defenses so strong the client doesn’t voice the underlying feelings. The therapist’s conjectures here bring out those hidden layers: suppressed anger, underlying fear, unresolved deep pain, implicit rebellion or confusion. These go beyond the immediate context into personal meaning. Because the clients are often somewhat defensive or unaware, the therapist must phrase these guesses delicately.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

Advanced empathic conjectures are tentative but insightful, often pointing to core emotional truths the client has not acknowledged. They use hedging like “I guess,” “I imagine,” “perhaps” and often frame the guess as part of a bigger picture: not just “maybe you’re angry,” but “maybe this leaves you angry,” linking it to the scenario. For instance: “I imagine that it’s like ‘I am so afraid.’”  – the therapist doesn’t directly say “You are afraid,” they put it as a hypothetical internal statement, which is less confrontational and allows the client to consider it. For the intruded one: “… but you actually feel so intruded upon and maybe angry inside…”  – adding “inside” and “maybe” emphasizes it’s hidden and a guess. It’s phrased as a contrast to what she shows (shutting down vs. actually feeling intruded/angry). This not only guesses the emotions, but also implies a dynamic (she doesn’t express them, hence shuts down). That’s a sophisticated observation delivered gently. The “feels okay now but touching something very deep … making it hard to keep going”  acknowledges his current claim of okay-ness, then introduces the conjecture about a deep issue interfering with therapy. The language “sounds like this is touching something very deep inside for you” is empathetic – it doesn’t specify what, just that something profound was triggered. And “making it hard to feel like you want to keep going” frames his desire to quit as an emotional resistance rather than a rational choice. It’s a powerful conjecture because it suggests he’s avoiding deeper pain (which in EFT context might be true). For the confused client: “I guess it is somehow scary to approach your feelings…”  – straightforwardly introduces fear as the reason for confusion, but said as “I guess” and “somehow scary,” acknowledging maybe the client hasn’t realized it’s fear. For the macho father belief: “That must leave you feeling very confusing and difficult, and could and perhaps leave you feeling angry?” . The wording is a bit awkward in the excerpt (maybe a transcription issue), but presumably: “That must be very confusing and difficult, and perhaps it also leaves you feeling angry?” He uses “must” there, which is slightly stronger, but “perhaps” and the question mark invite confirmation. Suggesting the client could be angry at father or the situation – which he might not have voiced because admitting any “weak” feeling might conflict with his belief. It’s a bold conjecture to suggest he’s angry about it, but done with “perhaps” and a question intonation. Overall, advanced conjectures often combine multiple feelings (e.g. confused and angry) because advanced issues often are multi-layered. They also sometimes speak to the impact: not just naming the feeling, but linking it to why the client is stuck (fear making them not want to start therapy, anger intruded making them shut down, etc.), as seen in these responses. The therapist is mapping cause and effect in the client’s emotional world. The tone remains gentle. They often use language that acknowledges complexity (“somehow scary,” “very deep inside,” “could perhaps leave you feeling X”). This is crucial in advanced cases because clients might be defensive; a too blunt “You’re angry at your father” could provoke denial. Instead, “perhaps you feel angry” opens a door. Another hallmark: using the client’s perspective or voice, e.g., “like ‘I am so afraid’” which internalizes the fear. It’s less accusatory than “you’re afraid.” High-quality advanced responses show empathy for the difficulty of those underlying feelings (e.g., “must be very confusing/difficult”), thereby normalizing them even as they surface them. Trainees reading these examples learn how to carefully unveil deeper feelings and dynamics in a tentative manner that still validates. It’s a delicate balance of insight and compassion. When done right, the client feels both understood and gently challenged to recognize an aspect of their experience they were avoiding.

## Exercise 9: Staying in Contact in the Face of Intense Affect

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

At the beginner stage, client statements that test a therapist’s ability to stay in contact despite intense emotion are typically emotionally charged but relatively straightforward expressions of strong feelings toward a person or situation. These markers can include positive transference (client expressing love/affection for therapist), intense grief or hopelessness, guilt over serious past actions, extreme anger, etc. They are the kinds of statements that might internally jolt a new therapist, making them want to flinch or change the subject – thus the skill is to stay present and responsive. For example: “You remind me of my daughter. I love her so much! She is perfect in every way.” . This is positive but very warm, which could make a beginner therapist bashful or uncertain how to respond to being idealized. Another: “Ever since I was fired… I have felt so depressed and hopeless. I have nothing to look forward to.” . This despair can be heavy; the therapist might feel an urge to offer platitudes, but the skill is to stay empathic. Next: “When my children were young, I couldn’t control my anger, and I hit them a lot… I feel really guilty… but I also feel like they should move on and forgive me already.” . This is loaded: admission of child abuse and conflict between guilt and defensiveness. A novice might internally recoil or judge; the challenge is to remain compassionate and non-shaming. Another marker: “My mother and sister both died this year. I don’t have any family left.”  – raw sorrow that might make a therapist feel speechless. And “I’ve been thinking a lot about my uncle who abused me… I’ve been feeling incredibly angry at him!” . That is intense anger at an abuser – it might provoke the therapist’s own anger or discomfort with the topic of sexual abuse, but the skill is to handle it steadily. All these statements reflect very strong affect: love/idealization, hopelessness, guilt/shame, deep grief, righteous anger about trauma. They match beginner level in that the client is quite open about the emotion (not much subtlety – they say “I love,” “I have nothing,” “I feel guilty,” “I am angry”). The key is that these are the types of affect that can cause a therapist to emotionally withdraw or become anxious. A “high-quality” marker here is one that powerfully evokes those challenges for the therapist, to practice staying emotionally engaged.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

For beginner-level intense affect, the therapist response should be to directly acknowledge and accept the intense emotion without retreating or escalating it, and to remain present with empathy. For the warm transference example (“You remind me of my daughter, I love her so much” presumably implying the client has warm feelings toward therapist by association), a good response: “Thank you for saying that. I feel touched to hear that.” . This simple response (provided in the text) does two things: it thanks the client and acknowledges being emotionally moved (“touched”). It’s straightforward, genuine, and keeps the connection. The therapist doesn’t freak out or overly downplay it; they accept the affection in a professional but warm manner. For the hopeless statement: “Somehow you just feel so hopeless, with nothing to look forward to.” . This response is basically an empathic reflection. The therapist doesn’t try to cheerlead or problem-solve; they stay with the hopeless feeling and validate it. It shows the client that the therapist isn’t afraid of their despair. For the guilt about abusing children: “So, it is hard and there is this incredible feeling of guilt and maybe shame, like ‘What did I do?’” . Here the therapist directly mirrors the client’s guilt and names shame (which the client might feel but only hinted at). The phrasing “incredible feeling of guilt” and voicing the likely self-critique (“What did I do?”) show the therapist is willing to engage with the gravity of what the client shared, without condemnation. This maintains contact by not shying away from the client’s guilt, and also not jumping into judgment or reassurance (“oh I’m sure your kids will forgive you” – that would be too distancing or fixing). The therapist stays with the client’s emotional reality. For the double family loss: “That sounds incredibly sad and hard.” . Very simple, but powerful. Sometimes just plainly acknowledging “incredibly sad” is what a grieving client needs – for the therapist to not run from their sadness. It shows presence. And for the anger at abusive uncle: “Just feeling so angry at him for abusing and mistreating you!” . The therapist essentially joins the client in condemning the uncle’s actions through the emotional lens – “so angry at him for doing that to you.” It validates the client’s anger fully. The exclamation point in the text suggests the therapist might even say it with some appropriate vigor, matching the client’s intensity (without losing therapeutic stance). That can be very supportive for the client – to see the therapist isn’t scared or repelled by their rage, but actually emotionally in tune with why they’d be furious. All these responses illustrate a key point: naming and validating the intense feeling, rather than avoiding it. They are often short and not fancy. For instance, “That sounds incredibly sad and hard” is the kind of straightforward thing a trainee might initially feel is too minimal, but in context it’s exactly what’s needed, because it shows the therapist is right there with the client’s pain. Another feature is using first or second person appropriately: e.g., “you just feel so hopeless” or “so angry at him for abusing and mistreating you!” – the therapist directly references the context, which shows they’re fully listening and not abstracting the emotion away from its cause. The tone is empathic, not pitying or overly dramatic; just genuine. These are excellent models for trainees – they see that when a client gives you intense emotion, you don’t have to fix it or run, you attune and respond with simple human empathy. It keeps the connection strong, which is the essence of this skill: the therapist stays emotionally present (“in contact”) when the client is at an emotional peak or sharing heavy material.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate scenarios where maintaining contact amid intense affect is needed might involve even more emotionally complex or self-destructive situations. Clients might bring intense love/attachment for a former therapist, imminent painful decisions (like euthanizing a pet), extreme anger with violent fantasies, shameful confessions (like a decades-long affair), or explicit suicidal ideation. These are more challenging because the feelings can be very conflicted or alarming. For example: “I’m starting therapy with you because my last therapist retired. She was amazing… we became real friends. I think of her every day.” . The client is expressing deep attachment to a former therapist – the new therapist might feel a bit jealous or like they’re competing with a ghost, but must stay empathic to the client’s loss. Another: “I think I am going to put my dog to sleep tomorrow… he’s been my best friend for a decade… How could I have my best friend killed?” . The client is sad and guilt-ridden. The intensity comes from love for the pet plus guilt of mercy killing. Another: “Whenever I read about politics, I become enraged… we just need to blow up the whole system.” . The client’s anger is extreme, borderline advocating violence. A therapist might instinctively want to calm them or push back, but the task is to stay engaged and hear the frustration. Next: “I have to confess that I have been having an affair for 20 years… I find myself wracked with guilt. It is unbearable.” . Here the intense affect is shame/guilt and the fear of judgment, and the therapist must manage their own shock perhaps, staying supportive. And: “My wife and I are getting divorced. I don’t think I can live without her… I think I should just kill myself.” . This is direct suicidal ideation in despair. Many therapists (especially new ones) would feel panic or urge to “fix” here, but maintaining contact means addressing the feeling of hopelessness empathetically in the moment, even as one also needs to assess safety. All these markers have multi-layered, intense emotions that could be overwhelming: grief, guilt, fury, shame, suicidal despair. They fit intermediate because the therapist might need to hold strong emotional space and also navigate risk or complex dynamics (like discussing a previous therapist, addressing political extremism, handling a dangerous statement). The clients are openly emotional but in different flavors (some angry, some despairing).

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

In these intermediate cases, the therapist’s responses show steady empathy and often an ability to contain the intensity by summarizing it or appreciating its significance, sometimes while simultaneously handling the content. For the retired therapist attachment: “It sounds like you had a very special relationship with her and that you were really close. She is still very present for you.” . This response respectfully acknowledges the depth of the client’s bond with the old therapist and affirms that loss. It doesn’t show jealousy or dismiss it; it values it (“very special relationship… she is still very present for you”). This keeps rapport: the client sees the new therapist isn’t threatened by the old one and truly understands their grief/longing. For the dog euthanasia: “It is just so painful to think about putting him down.” . Plain and heartfelt – the therapist doesn’t add much beyond exactly sympathizing with how painful that decision is. This tells the client the therapist isn’t judging (“you should, it’s the right thing, etc.”) or minimizing; they’re honoring the pain of it. Sometimes that’s all that’s needed. For the political rage: “So, you find yourself feeling incredibly angry.” . The therapist doesn’t engage in the content (like arguing about violence); they purely reflect the emotional state (“incredibly angry”). By doing so calmly, the therapist stays connected to the emotion behind the extreme statement, which often helps de-escalate a client because they feel heard in their frustration, not argued with. A more elaborate response might come later, but first acknowledging the depth of anger is key. For the 20-year affair confession: “I appreciate you sharing this with me. It is just this huge secret that you kept all these years, and now you find yourself wracked with an unbearable guilt.” . This response does many things well: It starts by appreciating the difficulty of confiding this secret (“I appreciate you sharing this” – reinforcing that the client did something courageous rather than should feel ashamed in therapy). It then acknowledges the enormity (“huge secret all these years”) which validates that it’s a big deal. And then empathizes fully with the result (“wracked with unbearable guilt”). The phrasing “unbearable guilt” exactly mirrors client’s words, showing the therapist is not flinching from how bad the client feels. It’s both supportive (for sharing) and deeply empathic (for the feeling). A new therapist might otherwise respond awkwardly or with visible shock, but this measured empathetic response keeps trust intact. For the divorce + suicidal talk: “It is just unimaginable to live life without her.” . This response (the first part of it, before footnote) captures the essence of his despair without directly mentioning the suicide comment but validating the feeling that life seems unimaginable now. In context, they added a footnote that actual suicidal intent needs to be assessed – but within the empathic connection, the therapist is focusing on the pain of loss behind the suicidal thought. Later they can address safety (footnotes indicate that being done outside the empathic reflection). So, staying in contact here means the therapist’s first instinct is to empathize (“life without her seems unimaginable”), not to scold or immediately contract for safety (though that will happen, the immediate client experience is “my therapist understands how hopeless I feel”). That initial empathic response can itself reduce some suicidal intensity because the client doesn’t feel alone or misunderstood in that moment. All these responses show a therapist who is steady, caring, and not overwhelmed by the client’s intense affect. They frequently use validations of magnitude: “very special,” “so painful,” “incredibly angry,” “huge secret,” “unbearable guilt,” “unimaginable” – these adjectives show the therapist truly recognizes how big these feelings are. That’s crucial; a timid or minimizing response would break contact. They also sometimes explicitly praise or appreciate the client’s openness (“appreciate you sharing this”) which can be important when clients disclose something shameful or intense – it reinforces that the therapist values honesty over comfort. Another aspect: the therapist remains genuine and human (none of these responses are formulaic or distant). They speak to the situation plainly, sometimes even use first person for themselves (like “I appreciate…”). This further solidifies the human-to-human contact. For trainees, these intermediate examples are great lessons: even when a client drops a “bomb” – a dark secret, a violent statement, a mention of suicide – the first thing to do is to empathically engage, not retreat or overreact. Show you can handle it by responding with compassion and understanding. Then, of course, you handle practicalities or boundaries, but the initial therapeutic bond must be maintained by that in-the-moment empathy.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced scenarios for maintaining contact in intense affect are probably the most challenging: they include very boundary-testing or ethically loaded situations directed at the therapist, extremely taboo or shocking confessions, explicitly violent fantasies toward others, and severe ruptures (client attacking the therapist’s competence or therapy’s effectiveness). These are the moments where a therapist might naturally feel defensive, frightened, or out of their depth. The skill is being able to stay engaged and not disconnect or react defensively. Some examples: “We’ve only had a few sessions, but I can already tell you are an amazing therapist… Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if we dated. Can you tell what I’m thinking right now?” . This is a direct flirtation / attempt at mind-reading, crossing boundaries. A therapist might freak out or shut it down abruptly. The advanced skill is to handle it with clear boundaries yet maintain the connection (not shaming the client for feeling attracted). Another: “Most of my parents’ family died in the Holocaust… I watched a movie about it… It makes me sick just to think about it.” . This is intense vicarious trauma and moral disgust; the therapist must hold that huge historical trauma’s personal impact without being overwhelmed themselves or trivializing. Another: “When my sister was very young, I touched her sexually… I think it really disturbed her… I feel so awful about this.” . This is a highly taboo confession (incest perpetration by the client). Many therapists would feel shock, repulsion, or at least strong discomfort. Yet, staying in contact means responding with professional compassion, not revulsion or punitive tone. Another: “Last week I discovered my wife has been cheating… I feel like smashing his face with a baseball bat.” . The client expresses actual violent urges. The therapist needs to manage safety (make sure it’s just fantasy) but also acknowledge the rage as understandable feeling given betrayal, so the client feels understood not condemned. Another: “Therapy isn’t working. You just don’t understand me. I feel worse… I think it’s because you’re a trainee and don’t have much experience.” . This is a direct attack on the therapist’s competence. Many therapists, especially trainees, would become defensive or demoralized. The skill is to handle this “rupture” gracefully – neither collapsing nor getting angry at the client – but addressing their frustration and concerns seriously and collaboratively. These are top-tier difficulty markers because they hit at therapist’s boundaries (sexual/romantic), personal triggers (Holocaust – huge tragedy; incest admission – big moral issue; violent threat – risk management; insult to therapist’s skill – personal/professional ego). A high-quality marker here is explicit, leaving no doubt of the intensity, so the therapist must respond carefully.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

The advanced responses we have illustrate remarkable composure and empathy combined with clear boundaries when necessary. For the flirty scenario: “I am glad that you feel comfortable and understood by me. The truth is, I cannot tell what you are thinking right now. It might be important for us to discuss the limits of our relationship, though, because this is a therapeutic relationship and not a romantic one.” . This response is pitch-perfect. It starts by validating the positive (client feels comfortable – “I’m glad”), and softly corrects the mind-reading notion (“I cannot tell what you’re thinking”). Then it sets a boundary in a gentle way: suggesting a talk about limits, clearly stating it’s not a romantic relationship but without scolding. The tone is professional but kind. The therapist stays connected by not showing disgust or shock at the attraction; they handle it matter-of-factly. This keeps the client engaged in therapy rather than feeling rejected (despite the necessary boundary). For the Holocaust-related disgust: “I am really sorry to hear that. It is horrible. And it sounds like it is really eating away at you right now, like just a strong feeling of disgust and maybe abhorrence?” . The therapist responds with sorrow/empathy (“really sorry… it is horrible,” aligning with client’s feelings about the tragedy) and then names the client’s feelings (“eating away at you… disgust and maybe abhorrence”). By doing that, the therapist validates the client’s emotional response to the horror. The therapist doesn’t shy from agreeing “it is horrible” – showing solidarity with the client’s moral outrage. They keep the focus on how it’s affecting the client. This response shows the therapist can stomach hearing about the Holocaust and the client’s distress without diverting the topic. For the incest perpetration reveal: “This must be very difficult to say out loud, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. It sounds like something you feel really bad about and we need to explore it further.” . Again, starts with acknowledging difficulty and appreciating honesty (key to keep client from shutting down in shame). Then, rather than jumping into condemnation or even reassurance, the therapist calmly states “you feel really bad and we should explore it.” This indicates the therapist is not running away from it, and sees it as something to work through. The lack of shock or moral judgment in the response is notable (though internally the therapist might have feelings, they remain steady). It keeps the client engaged and shows commitment to help them with even this issue. For the violent revenge fantasy: “That must have been horribly shocking and disturbing to find out! Your rage is very understandable.” . The therapist first empathizes with the shock of discovering infidelity (which likely partly fuels the violent impulse), then straightforwardly validates the rage as understandable. They don’t explicitly address the bat comment now; the first priority is empathizing. By saying “very understandable,” the therapist conveys “I’m not afraid of your anger; I get why you feel that.” (Of course, if they suspected he might act, they’d later discuss not acting on it, as footnote suggests regarding homicidal risk. But initial response is empathy, not “whoa you can’t do that.”) This approach defuses some need for violence by acknowledging the feeling. For the therapy isn’t working attack: “I really appreciate you telling me how you have been feeling. And it must be difficult to feel worse than when you started. Let’s discuss this further. I am a trainee, although I have a few years of experience. I feel that I can help you and would like to find a way, but if this does not feel like a good fit for you, we can discuss alternatives.” . This response is exemplary of handling a rupture: The therapist stays calm and receptive, first thanking the client for the feedback (encouraging openness, showing no defensiveness). Then empathizing “it must be difficult to feel worse” – acknowledging the client’s pain and frustration. Then they invite discussion rather than getting defensive or apologizing profusely or ignoring it (“Let’s discuss further”). They address the criticism about being a trainee honestly: they confirm they are a trainee but note their experience level (transparency to maintain trust), and assert they believe they can help (confidence in self, which can reassure the client). Yet, they also leave the door open kindly (“if not a good fit, we can explore alternatives”), which shows they put the client’s needs first over their ego. This response maintains respect for the client’s autonomy and does not personalize the attack – it stays focused on what will help the client. Throughout, the tone is professional, non-defensive, caring, and proactive about resolution. It’s a tough balance that this response handles well. All these advanced responses illustrate a key principle: presence plus professionalism. The therapist deals with the content (boundaries with flirting, clarifying role, addressing competence) in a way that still centers the client’s feelings and needs. They show no sign of abandonment – even when the client is attacking or presenting extreme content, the therapist’s words say “I’m here, I hear you, and I’m not giving up on working with you (unless you want that).” In doing so, they model stability and safety, which is crucial in intense affect moments. These responses likely defuse a lot of immediate tension or potential rupture: the flirty client feels gently let down but cared for, the traumatized client feels validated, the shameful client feels accepted, the furious client feels understood, and the dissatisfied client feels taken seriously and collaboratively engaged. Trainees reading these can learn that even in worst-case scenarios, a therapist’s composed, empathetic reply can salvage and even strengthen the therapeutic alliance. It’s about managing one’s own reactions and focusing on understanding the client’s perspective and feelings first, addressing practical or boundary issues in the same breath or next, but always in a calm, respectful tone.

## Exercise 10: Self-Disclosure

### Beginner Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Beginner-level client statements that prompt therapist self-disclosure are usually simple, direct questions about the therapist or the therapy process, or expressions of feeling that implicitly seek reassurance of the therapist’s view. They can be innocuous or anxiety-driven. Examples: “So should I just start anywhere or…?”  (client unsure how to begin first session – maybe expecting direction, could prompt therapist to reveal how they usually start). “Are you married?”  (direct personal question). “I’m Christian, my faith is big; is that okay with you?”  (client testing for acceptance, maybe wanting to know therapist’s stance on religion – which could lead the therapist to disclose their openness or even their own faith stance). “Wow, I’m such a mess. You must think I’m crazy, right?”  (client fishing for the therapist’s perspective of them – possibly wanting reassurance that the therapist doesn’t view them negatively – this invites a self-disclosure of the therapist’s impression). “I feel so vulnerable and alone, talking about this.”  (client revealing their emotional state possibly wanting to know how the therapist is reacting; maybe implicitly asking for some response beyond silent listening – a place for the therapist to share their emotional reaction e.g. feeling moved). These markers are straightforward, often in question form. They match beginner because they deal with basic boundaries or initial rapport: the client is basically asking for factual info or basic reassurance about the therapist’s opinion. A high-quality marker clearly invites or could benefit from a bit of therapist openness to strengthen trust. For instance, a direct question about therapist’s personal life or a direct assumption “you must think X about me” clearly calls for some response beyond neutrality.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

At beginner level, appropriate self-disclosure is brief, directly addresses the client’s query or concern, and then often refocuses on the client. The idea is to be open enough to satisfy the client’s need and model genuineness, without shifting focus to the therapist unnecessarily. Examples from the text: “I am very excited to begin our work together and to hear what brought you in today.”  for “Should I start anywhere?” This is not a deep personal fact, but it’s a self-disclosure of the therapist’s emotion (excited) and sets a welcoming tone, which likely helps the anxious client. It’s straightforward and positive, encouraging the client to proceed. For the marriage question: “Yes, I am married, and I have two children. I am curious about what that means to you?” (or alternative “No, I am not married. I am curious what that means to you?”) . This directly answers the personal question with a simple fact (which builds trust via honesty) and immediately turns it back to the client’s concern (“what does that mean to you?”), inviting exploration of why the client asked. This is exemplary: it doesn’t dodge, but also doesn’t dwell on the therapist’s life – it uses the disclosure to further therapy. For the faith question: “Yes, that is definitely okay. I feel open to working with people of varying faiths and spiritual belief systems.” . Here the therapist discloses their stance (“I feel open to…”), which addresses the underlying worry (that maybe it wouldn’t be okay). It’s concise and assures the client of acceptance. The “such a mess, you must think I’m crazy” comment gets: “I do not see you as crazy at all. Actually, I feel a lot of concern and empathy for you.” . This is a direct self-disclosure of the therapist’s perception (“I do not see you as crazy”) and feelings (“I feel a lot of concern and empathy”). It is exactly what a client in that moment likely needs to hear – an explicit corrective to their fear of judgment. And it’s phrased warmly (“concern and empathy” vs. something distant). For the vulnerable alone comment: “I feel moved to hear you share your vulnerable feelings with me now.” . The therapist here discloses their emotional reaction (“moved”) which is a gentle way of saying “Your openness affects me, I care.” That likely reassures the client that their vulnerability is met with empathy rather than apathy or discomfort. These examples show key traits: they all use “I” statements about the therapist’s feelings or status where appropriate. They are honest (the therapist doesn’t hide being married or not, for instance). They are brief and then the conversation can go back to client. There’s no oversharing irrelevant details (the marriage answer didn’t go on about spouse’s name, etc., just enough to answer). They directly tackle any misconception (“you must think I’m crazy” -> “No, I do not think that”). The tone is caring and confident. For trainees, this is instructive because many early therapists either err on too much self-disclosure or too little (stonewalling). These demonstrate the middle ground: answer natural personal questions plainly, correct false assumptions about therapist’s view of client, and share appropriate emotional reactions. That fosters trust and a sense that the therapist is a real person engaged in the relationship.

### Intermediate Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Intermediate markers where self-disclosure is useful often involve clients expressing discomfort with therapy or the therapist, or personal questions that might be more challenging or loaded (like noticing therapist’s behavior, direct comments about therapy making them uneasy, or significant events that the therapist might relate to). For example: “I’ve seen you yawn a few times today. Am I boring you?” . The client directly calls out the therapist’s possibly involuntary behavior – that’s a sensitive moment requiring honesty (maybe the therapist is a bit tired, etc.). “Just coming to therapy and sitting here with you makes me feel really uncomfortable.” . The client is frank about discomfort with the process or the interpersonal dynamic; a therapist might respond by inviting exploration and perhaps reassure (disclose that they value that honesty, etc.). “Sometimes I think you get bored listening to me talk about my problems every week. Is that true?” . The client is voicing a fear of burdening the therapist, basically asking the therapist to disclose if they feel bored or not. This begs a transparent answer and likely some reassurance plus a look at why they worry so. “I had to put my dog to sleep this weekend… my heart is broken into a million pieces.” . The client is extremely sad; while this doesn’t directly ask for self-disclosure, a therapist might spontaneously self-disclose empathy or relate if appropriate (like mention if they’ve lost pets – but careful at intermediate to not overshadow the client). The key difference at intermediate is these questions or statements require a bit more nuance – the yawning one could embarrass the therapist, the boredom one could put them on the spot about their feelings towards therapy, the discomfort one is somewhat vague, etc. The therapist’s self-disclosure in these scenarios might include admitting a human trait (fatigue) without undermining the therapy, or acknowledging any stuckness and collaborating to improve it.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

The intermediate responses in the text show balanced candor and empathy. For yawning: “Oh, I am really sorry. I am a bit tired today, but it does not reflect on how I am feeling about you or what you are talking about.” . This is an excellent response: the therapist apologizes (which shows care), then discloses truthfully “I am a bit tired today” – a normal human thing – and then very clearly states it’s not because of the client or content (“does not reflect on how I feel about you or what you’re saying”). This likely relieves the client’s worry that they’re boring. It’s straightforward, owning the behavior (yawn) as therapist’s physical state, not client’s fault. For “uncomfortable with just sitting here”: “I am sorry to hear you are uncomfortable, although I really appreciate you telling me that. Maybe we can explore what makes you feel uncomfortable.” . Here the therapist’s “self-disclosure” is not about personal life, but they convey personal caring (“I am sorry… I really appreciate you telling me”). That is a form of genuineness, valuing the feedback. Then they open an exploration, which implicitly says “I’m willing to address this, not defensive.” That keeps alliance. For “I think you get bored hearing me, is that true?”: “Wow, it must have been hard to ask me that. I do appreciate you sharing that concern. I want to address that directly. I do not feel bored at all. At times, though, I have felt we are a little stuck. I would like to work together to figure out how to deepen your emotional experiencing during sessions.” . This is a wonderful multi-part response. First, it acknowledges the courage (“hard to ask, appreciate you sharing”). Then “I want to address directly” – signals honesty. Then an unambiguous disclosure: “I do not feel bored at all.” That reassures the client. Then the therapist candidly shares a constructive observation: “At times I have felt we are a little stuck” – which is a mild negative about the process, not the person. This is a brave disclosure, essentially admitting “we might not be making progress at some points,” but it’s phrased collaboratively (“we are stuck” not “you are stuck”). Then they propose working together to deepen the work. This self-disclosure acknowledges a possible issue (lack of depth) but also says the therapist is committed to improving it with the client. It’s very respectful and proactive. For the grief over dog (heart broken): “As you’re telling me this, I just feel so sad, moved to tears.” . The therapist self-discloses their emotional resonance (“moved to tears”). This is likely a genuine reaction – perhaps the therapist’s eyes welled up. Some might shy from admitting tears, but doing so here shows solidarity in grief and that the therapist truly empathizes. It’s done succinctly and focuses still on the client’s story (implying “your story touches me deeply”). This can be very validating for the client (their feelings are so understandable that even an outsider is moved by them). In all these examples, the therapist’s responses combine authenticity with professionalism: They tell the truth (tired, not bored, feeling stuck sometimes, feeling sad hearing this) but in a way that keeps the focus on helping the client (ensuring the client doesn’t misinterpret yawns, inviting discussion of discomfort, planning to deepen therapy, sharing sadness to validate client’s). They handle potential ruptures (client’s fear they bore therapist) by immediate and clear reassurance plus constructive openness about the process. They handle personal queries by being forthcoming (marital status, etc.). None of these feels too much or irrelevant – they are directly answering the client’s concern, which is what good self-disclosure should do. Trainees can see that one can apologize or admit small imperfections (yawning) without losing authority, and can share feelings to build connection. The language is polite (“Oh, I’m really sorry,” “Wow, it must have been hard…”). They commend client’s openness where relevant, reinforcing a norm of open communication. Essentially, these intermediate disclosures strengthen the alliance and model honesty.

### Advanced Level

#### High-Quality Client Markers

Advanced moments for self-disclosure are often when clients test boundaries strongly or have critical or very sensitive queries. They might repeatedly violate rules (like chronic lateness), ask very personal or even inappropriate questions, or confront the therapist’s competence in a more severe way. Examples: Client arrives 20 min late for 4th time and breezes in with “Hi, I know I’m late… Where should we start?” . That’s testing how the therapist handles repeated lateness. The therapist’s response might involve disclosing feeling concerned about the pattern or setting boundaries while staying empathic (they might say how it affects session). Next: “I’ve always been self-conscious about how I look. Other kids teased me… Do you think that I am attractive?” . This is a direct, somewhat awkward question putting the therapist in a tight spot (if they answer either way, it’s tricky). Self-disclosure here might be about how the therapist perceives answering that and shifting to client’s self-perception. Another: “I hate it when you get that look of pity in your eyes. Don’t look down at me!” . This is a client angrily calling out the therapist’s facial expression. The therapist might need to disclose their actual feeling vs. what the client interprets (e.g., “I am sorry; I wasn’t feeling pity, I was feeling concerned/sad for your situation, but I see it came across wrong”). Another: “I can tell you don’t have a lot of experience. I wanted an experienced therapist. How can I be sure you can help me?” . This is a blunt challenge to therapist’s ability. The therapist likely should respond with transparency about their training and emphasize their resources or prior successes (a bit like earlier intermediate example but even more pointed). Possibly mention being supervised, etc., to reassure. So advanced markers are intense because they either border on boundary crossing (appearance question, chronic tardiness) or strong negative transference/critique (accusations of pity, lack of experience). They’re advanced because the therapist might feel quite uncomfortable – disclosing here can be risky but also necessary to address the dynamic.

#### High-Quality Therapist Responses

The text’s advanced responses (some implied from exercise 12 advanced earlier and also likely from other sources in EFT or general practice) could be: For chronic lateness example, one from exercise 12 advanced is not explicitly given, but one can imagine an optimal response includes setting limits and exploring cause. Perhaps: “I notice you’ve been late several times. I’m concerned because we lose valuable time, and I wonder if something is making it hard to get here on time that we should talk about.” This discloses the therapist’s concern and invites discussion. It’s direct about the boundary but also curious rather than punitive. [We don’t have a direct quote in text for that scenario, but that approach matches EFT style – address pattern empathically.] For the appearance question: That’s tricky – often recommended to turn it back (“What makes you ask that?”). But a gentle disclosure might be: “I think it’s understandable you worry about that given how you were teased. I don’t see you as unattractive, but what matters is how you feel about yourself.” If one strictly follows no personal opinions, they might dodge, but possibly an honest reassurance “I’m not thinking of you in those terms” could help. Without a provided text, I’ll rely on therapy best practices: Affirm the client’s worry, refuse to objectify them but probably say something like the above. For the “pitying look” accusation: The intermediate example did something similar with “bored” – it acknowledged and corrected. So an ideal response: “I am very pleased you brought this up. I am sorry that I seem tired or bored. I am not aware of feeling that… [addresses it]  – Actually, that is directly from intermediate. For pity specifically, one might say: “I’m glad you told me this. I certainly don’t want to look down at you or make you feel pitied. When I had that expression, I was feeling concerned (or deeply moved) about what you were saying, not thinking less of you. But I hear it made you feel disrespected, and I apologize for that. It’s important you feel I respect you – because I absolutely do.” This kind of response is a self-disclosure of what the look actually was (therapist’s actual feeling), plus an apology and clarification. It maintains contact by addressing the rupture transparently and caringly. For the “inexperienced” critique: The intermediate advanced one from exercise 12’s final advanced response covers this: “I am a trainee, although I have a few years of experience… I feel I can help you and would like to… if not a good fit we can discuss alternatives.” . That was exactly how to handle being called inexperienced. It’s likely exactly what to do here. That response we already analysed – it was thorough. Possibly that one was the advanced scenario, not intermediate. Actually, it was advanced in exercise 12 advanced statement 5. Yes, that matches “you’re a trainee, I think that’s why it’s not working.” The provided response in [13] covers it nicely (appreciate honesty, must be hard, direct address, truth about being trainee and experience, commitment to help, alternative if needed). We already commended that approach. Summarizing key elements: Ownership of truth (yes I am a trainee, or yes I did look like that apparently), reassurance of commitment/concern, apology if needed, collaborative tone. All done without defensiveness. The advanced responses require high skill: the therapist has to manage personal feelings (maybe hurt at being called inexperienced or anger at being accused of pity) and respond constructively. The mentioned ideal responses do that by focusing on the client’s perception and experience, validating them (like “I’m glad you told me”), clarifying therapist’s actual stance, and reaffirming care and respect. They often involve a bit more content than lower levels because the situations are more fraught. E.g., the trainee response was lengthy to cover all bases, which is appropriate. This shows trainees that when confronted directly, honesty paired with humility and empathy is the best policy. It doesn’t diminish the therapist – in fact, it often increases the client’s respect if done well. Being open about one’s status but confident in one’s ability (with backup plans) as in that response is ideal. For boundary issues (like lateness or direct questions), the therapist answers clearly (maybe you do have to say “It’s not appropriate for me to comment on your attractiveness in that way, but I can say I’m not thinking negative things about how you look” – a boundary with reassurance). Maintaining contact means not scolding or shutting the client down, but also not giving in to something unethical (like crossing a boundary). It’s a delicate dance of being firm yet kind. All these advanced disclosures, actual or hypothesized from best practice, emphasize honesty, boundaries, respect, and the primacy of the client’s feelings. They demonstrate that even tough moments can be navigated in a way that preserves or even enhances the therapeutic relationship.
