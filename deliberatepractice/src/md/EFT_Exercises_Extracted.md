## EXERCISE 1. Therapist Self-Awareness

### Beginner — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Loving ] I was playing with my dog the other day, and I just became so aware of how much I love him. He’s been an incredible partner through all my hard times, and honestly, I don’t know where I’d be without him. It feels like every time I was sad, sick, anxious, or self-critical, he would kind of notice and be there for me. I feel really blessed that despite all the hard things going on in my life, I have such a beautiful creature that’s so unconditionally there for me.

**Statement 2.** [Nervous ] I’m excited about starting therapy with you, but I’m also kind of nervous. I’ve never been in therapy before. I’m not even sure how therapy works. I’m also a bit worried that my problems are maybe just all in my head and talking about them could make it worse?

**Statement 3.** [Anxious ] I’m coming to therapy because I just moved here, and I’m having some trouble adjusting. The people here are very different than where I grew up. Everyone here talks faster and seems kind of rude. Where I grew up, people are very calm and polite. Can you help me with this?

**Statement 4.** [Uncomfortable ] Last night I had the strangest dream. I was in the house where I grew up. A monster was chasing me room to room. I was scared, so I hid under a bed. Then you appeared under the bed and said you’d help me! I was surprised to see you but also relieved. We started planning what to cook for dinner, which felt strange and a bit uncomfortable. Then I woke up.

**Statement 5.** [Hopeful ] I’m very excited to start therapy again. My last therapist was very helpful. She taught me how to calm myself down when I had panic attacks and also how to have more positive thoughts about myself. I’m coming back to therapy because my work has gotten tough and I’m having some frustration with my boss. Can you help me with this?

### Beginner — Example Therapist Responses

### Intermediate — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Ashamed ] Today I tried to cook something new and it turned out terrible. I always mess up these things. I guess my mother was right: Why do I even bother with pretending to be an adult? I guess I’m just much more dependent than I ever thought I would be at this age. Does this mean that I’m never going to be successful in my career?

**Statement 2.** [Concerned ] Before we start therapy, can you answer some questions about yourself? Are you religious? If so, what religion? If not, do you have any problems with religious people? I am Muslim, I am honestly unsure if a therapist without religious faith could understand my life. My religious faith is a very important part of my life. My last therapist didn’t respect my religious beliefs, so I want to make sure that you will.

**Statement 3.** [Sad] When my ex broke up with me, I just felt totally lost and abandoned. And I still do. It’s like nothing makes sense, and all I can think about is “what went wrong?” and “why is this happening to me?” We had so many plans for our future together. We spoke of living together, marrying, having kids. (pauses) And now that’s all gone. It’ll never happen, and it’s awful. I lost the most important person in my life. And now I’m scared that I’ll never be able to trust another person again or that I’ll never find anyone who loved me like that.

**Statement 4.** [Stoned ] I’ve got something to tell you that I’ve been hesitant to say, but I think is important for you to know. I’ve smoked pot before coming to our last few sessions, and also today. It helps me relax and feel more comfortable here. I think marijuana can help me find my true self. I hope you are okay with this?

**Statement 5.** [Angry ] I feel really disappointed about not getting that job promotion. It’s so unfair! My supervisor has always been unfair to me about these things. I’m really tired of being treated like I’m second rate. And I just feel like quitting when all my work goes by unnoticed. I mean, what else does he want from me? Sometimes I just fantasize about punching him in the face.

### Advanced — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Hopeless ] I’m feeling much more depressed this week. I’ve felt so bad for so long, I just don’t know how much more of this I can take. I just feel totally helpless. I don’t even want to get out of bed in the morning. On the drive over here today, I saw a huge truck, and had an image of driving my car into the truck head-on. It would just be such a relief not to be alive and fight this depression anymore.

**Statement 2.** [Skeptical ] How much training and experience do you have? To be totally honest, I’m worried about doing therapy with a trainee. Are you sure that you will be able to help me? I’ve got serious trauma in my history, and I don’t know if you can handle it.

**Statement 3.** [Flirty ] So there’s something I’ve been thinking about and that I wanted to share with you. I hope it’s okay and that you don’t freak out about it. The thing is, for the longest time I’ve been feeling attracted to you. Maybe you noticed some signs of that? I mean, I think our work together is good, and I think I’ve been helped a lot. But I also wonder what it would be like if we had met under different circumstances. I think about that a lot, actually. I also notice that you dress very well for our sessions and imagine you are trying to look nice for me. I like that outfit you are wearing. Again, I don’t want to freak you out, I just wanted to let you know that I think you’re wonderful and would probably make a great partner. And, well . . . I was wondering if you ever thought about me that way?

**Statement 4.** [Distrusting ] I’ve been thinking about our last session, and I don’t think it was helpful. I really don’t understand what we are doing here in therapy or how it can help me. Do you have some kind of agenda or plan that you haven’t told me about? Is this how you help your other clients, or are you treating me differently? Honestly, I feel very frustrated with you right now and I’m not sure if I trust you.

**Statement 5.** [Skeptical ] I only came to therapy because my wife made me. She thinks I have a drinking problem. But she’s totally wrong, I just have a few drinks at night to calm down because my job is very hard and stressful. She doesn’t understand this because she’s a woman, and women don’t know what it’s like to work hard jobs. Also, to be totally honest, I think I drink because of her and her nagging. I know that isn’t very politically correct to say, but I hope I can be direct here and that you can handle the truth.

You are very puzzled as to why, but somehow you are feeling so depressed and down.

### Advanced — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Worried] I’m trying to let go of alcohol, but I’ve never dealt with my anxiety in any other way in the past. It’s actually been so useful to get drunk and feel fun and spontaneous, and I don’t know if I can manage without it.

**Statement 2.** [Frustrated] I try to convince myself that what my father told me in the past was wrong, that I am worthwhile, that my opinions do matter. But why don’t I feel any different, even if I can now see that he was wrong?

**Statement 3.** [Embarrassed] I am not sure whether to talk about this and I am kind of embarrassed to say so, but I have gained a lot of weight recently. If I don’t get to the gym to work out, then I am really angry at myself.

I don’t know what to do.

**Response 2 — to Advanced Client Statement 2**

So, despite knowing he was wrong, deep down you still feel not worthwhile.

**Response 3 — to Advanced Client Statement 3**

So, it is hard to talk about it because you are feeling very bad, but at times you are aware of yourself engaging in sort of “mindless eating.”

Of course. In our sessions we are going to explore your emotions together, discuss how you feel about things, solve problems, and help you decide on the best course of action for you.

Talking about your feelings can help you understand what you feel so that you can better identify what you need.

**Statement 2.** [Hopeful ] My friends on Facebook are always happy and positive. I want to be like that. Can you help me with this?

**Statement 3.** [Skeptical ] If I talk about feeling sad or angry, couldn’t I just feel worse?

**Statement 5.** [Ashamed ] I’m embarrassed of how sad I feel all the time, and I’m worried that if I start crying here, I won’t be able to stop. I think I look ugly when I cry.

### Intermediate — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Intermediate Client Statement 1**

This is very common concern, and I appreciate you sharing it. You see, at their core, feelings give us important information, and when we’re comfortable experiencing and expressing feelings, we are usually more able to meet our needs.

**Response 2 — to Intermediate Client Statement 2**

It seems to you that everyone around you is so happy. That must feel difficult. We can work toward helping you find more inner satisfaction by focusing on what is getting you down and trying to change that.

**Response 3 — to Intermediate Client Statement 3**

Sometimes talking about difficult feelings can make you feel temporarily worse, although sometimes it actually makes you feel better. Overall, it is helpful to share your feelings with someone, so you feel less isolated and alone with those feelings.

**Response 4 — to Intermediate Client Statement 4**

I know it sometimes feels like our feelings don’t make sense, but actually there is often a lot of sense in your feelings. By giving your inner world a voice, we can work together to try to figure out which feelings you want to listen to and which ones are not helping you. Those are the feelings we want to help transform.

**Response 5 — to Intermediate Client Statement 5**

That sounds like a difficult experience. You somehow feel like your sadness and tears are ugly. I actually think they are so important—and important to listen to. After all, therapy is a place that you can cry, and I imagine this is some of what we will do here together. Providing Treatment Rationale for Emotion-Focused Therapy 71

### Advanced — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Very skeptical ] I don’t think this is going to work for me because my emotions are part of the problem. That’s what I want you to help me with, to feel less!

**Statement 2.** [Very skeptical ] How can you guarantee that if I go into my painful emotions, I am going to feel better afterward? My experience has been that I go in there and get lost and just feel worse. How will this be different?

**Statement 3.** [Afraid ] I’ve had bad experiences in therapy before. My last therapist tried to make me talk about my past traumas. How can I know that I am safe with you?

**Statement 4.** [Self-blaming ] I hate that I can’t control my feelings. I believe this makes me weak. I want to control my feelings, so I can be strong. Can you help me with this?

**Statement 5.** [Confused ] My doctor said I have an anger problem. When I get really angry, I lose control and hit people. Is safe for me to explore my feelings? Shouldn’t I just try to get rid of my anger?

### Advanced — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Advanced Client Statement 1**

I understand your experience tells you that emotions can sometimes feel dangerous or disorganizing. Here we are going to explore your feelings, but in some new ways you might not have done before. This is important as it will give us a sense of what is missing for you and what you need. Remember that I will be on this journey with you.

**Response 2 — to Advanced Client Statement 2**

Thank you for asking, this is very important, and you’re not alone in that experience. Maybe I could clarify when and why emotions can be healthy and helpful. Emotion motivates and helps you get your needs met because it tells you what is missing. For example, sadness tells you that you have lost something important to you and can allow you to let go and organize to find something new. Anger helps you set boundaries and feel deserving when you have been violated. Loneliness tells you what you need to feel connected and motivates you to reach out. Anxiety and fear tell you that you do not feel safe and that you need protection. So, emotions usually tell us what we need, help us get needs met, help us remember what is important to us, and help us connect. Does that make sense?

**Response 3 — to Advanced Client Statement 3**

I know it can be difficult to talk about past traumas. And we need to go slow and at a pace that you feel comfortable with. I actually do think it is important to be able to talk about what happened to you and process the feelings around it, in a safe place. How about we take it at a pace you feel comfortable with where you decide how deep you want to go.

**Response 4 — to Advanced Client Statement 4**

Yes, it can feel very distressing when you feel out of control. And it sounds like that does leave you feeling weak. I don’t believe that controlling feelings makes you stronger, but we can explore that. In many ways, I think it is strong to be able to allow your feelings. You can then have choice over when to express them. But we discuss it. How does it sound to you?

**Response 5 — to Advanced Client Statement 5**

I think we need to look into your anger a little further. Hitting people is not a good thing, and I agree that we need to work on it. Maybe we need to consider strategies to help you get anger under control. Also, it is important to look at what is driving that anger, what is underneath it. Sometimes it can be helpful to get, to feelings underneath your anger. This refocusing helps you actually get anger under control. 73Preparation 1. R ead the instructions in

I am a trainee, although I have a few years of experience. I feel that I can help you and would like to find a way, but if this does not feel like a good fit for you, we can discuss alternatives. 2. T rainees should seek close supervision for clients who may be at risk of harming others. Note that although statements such as “I want to smash his face with a baseball bat” and “I want to beat him to a pulp” may be no more than strong expressions of anger and not actual statements of intent, if the therapist assesses that a client is actually homicidal, the therapist should consider breaking informed consent and notifying relevant parties or a homicide-focused treatment. If therapists are unsure what to do, it is recommended that they consult a colleague or supervisor.

### Beginner — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Beginner Client Statement 1**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-evaluative split.] It sounds like you are being very hard on yourself and criticizing yourself for being too fat.

**Response 2 — to Beginner Client Statement 2**

What do you do to silence him?

**Response 4 — to Beginner Client Statement 4**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-interruptive split.] So, it is hard for you to cry and you just tighten up. Would it be okay for us to work on this a little? Can you come over to this chair [points to the other chair]? [Once the client is in the interrupter’s chair] Imagine yourself over there crying [points back to the original chair]. Try telling her why she shouldn’t cry. How do you stop her from crying? What do you say or do to her to stop her? Maybe you squeeze back her tears or choke her. Imagine her over there and let’s see if you can actually do it now. 1. The ther apist trainee should remember that it may feel awkward at first to suggest that someone criticize or put themselves down. By doing chair work, however, clients gain awareness and take ownership for how they criticize themselves. Remember that the aim of the dialogue is to become aware of the critic so that clients can assert themselves back to it, softening and transforming the critic. 2. The ther apist trainee should remember that the goal of the self-interruptive dialogue is to gain awareness of how clients block or interrupt themselves so that they can take internal responsibility for the process and make choices in favor of self-expression. 132 Deliberate Practice Exercises for Emotion-Focused Therapy Skills

**Statement 4.** [Shameful ] I have to confess something. When my wife was alive, I had an affair and I never told her. Even though my wife has died, I am left with this horrible sense of guilt about it, and I just can’t stop thinking about it these days.

**Statement 5.** [Slow and flat ] When bad things happen to me, I don’t feel anything. For example, when my husband left me I did not feel anything. I feel like I should be angry or hurt, but I just feel numb.

### Intermediate — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Intermediate Client Statement 1**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of unfinished business.] So, it is hard because you did not get a chance to say goodbye. And even though it feels like there is nothing you can do about it now, it is still hard to live with that feeling. [Pulls the chair up in front of the client] Maybe we could try bringing her here in imagination so you could have a dialogue with her and say goodbye and maybe get to tell her some of the things you would have like to have told her.

**Response 2 — to Intermediate Client Statement 2**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-evaluative split.] That sounds very painful. It also sounds like you are giving yourself a very hard time about it and really coming down heavily on yourself. Can we try to get at how you blame yourself? Because it does seem like you are really beating up on yourself and that leaves you feeling very bad. As a way of trying to deal with that and to help you fight back from inside yourself, can we try to get a sense of how you put yourself down? Can you come over here [moves the client to the other chair] and give yourself a hard time? See if you can do it now.

**Response 3 — to Intermediate Client Statement 3**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-evaluative split.] So, it is hard to imagine someone truly loving you. I get a strong sense of the negative messages you give yourself, how you put yourself down and make yourself feel like you are not worth loving. Will you come over here to this chair [points to the other chair] and make her feel like she is not lovable [points back to the original chair the client was sitting in]. What do you say to yourself to make yourself feel not lovable? Marker Recognition and Chair Work Task Setup 133

**Response 4 — to Intermediate Client Statement 4**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of unfinished business.] That sounds very painful. It also sounds very much unresolved. Perhaps we could try something around this to help you come to terms with what you did. Would you be willing to bring your wife here [pulls up chair in front of client], in imagination, and have a dialogue with her and maybe tell her your feelings about what happened, what you did?

**Response 5 — to Intermediate Client Statement 5**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-interruptive split.] It sounds like you are blocking some pretty painful feelings. Let’s get a sense of how you do this. Can you come to this other chair? [Once the client is sitting in the other chair] Imagine yourself over there [points back to the original chair], and can you actually try to stop your feelings? Imagine you over there [points again to the chair across from the client], and what do you do to numb yourself, and can you actually do it now? How do you stop her from feeling angry or hurt? Do you sit on her? Do you stuff a sock in her mouth? Put a big steel door in front of her? In imagination, what would you actually do?

### Advanced — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Sad] Most of my grandfather’s family died in the Holocaust. I watched a movie about it the other day. I can’t believe how many millions of people were killed, including children. You know my grandfather survived the Holocaust at great expense, but he really did a number on my mother. I think that is why she was so cold to me. Even though I feel sorry for her, I still don’t forgive her for how she was with me. I still find myself hating her.

**Statement 2.** [Guilty ] I left my abusive husband 5 years ago. I had to sneak out of our house in the middle of the night with my 5- and 2-year-olds. I don’t regret leaving, but I can’t believe how stupid I was to have ever married him. I am so depressed.

**Statement 3.** [Angry ] You know, even though it has been a couple years and we are divorced now, I am still so angry that my wife cheated on me. I still have images of her with him in bed. I am feeling so betrayed and angry! I hate her!

**Statement 4.** [Angry ] I find myself worrying about everything these days. I worry about my kids now that they are both away from home and that something will happen to them. I worry about these pains in my stomach and think maybe I have cancer. I worry about the government and think we might be heading for the next world war. It is overwhelming. I just worry about everything!

**Statement 5.** [Tense and nervous ] I am so angry with my father. I really hate him, but I could never say that to him, even in this imaginary dialogue.

### Advanced — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Advanced Client Statement 1**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of unfinished business.] It sounds like you have a lot of strong feelings toward your mother, though you also feel sorry for her at the same time, being the child of a Holocaust survivor. [Pulls the chair up in front of the client] Perhaps we can try having a dialogue with her where we bring her here in imagination and tell her about how you feel about how she was with you.

**Response 2 — to Advanced Client Statement 2**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-evaluative split.] Yes, you left 5 years ago, and you carry all this guilt about ever marrying him in the first place. I wonder what you feel when you blame yourself. It must hurt. Can we try to work on this though so you can come to terms with it? Can you come over to this chair here and blame yourself? How do you do that? [Moves the client to the other chair and asks them to blame themself]

**Response 3 — to Advanced Client Statement 3**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of unfinished business.] Yes, it does sound like you still have a lot of feelings about what happened. Perhaps we can work on this to try to get help you get through this and move forward. [Pulls the chair up in front of the client] Can we try having a dialogue with your wife so you can actually tell her about your feelings and how you feel about it what she did? 134 Deliberate Practice Exercises for Emotion-Focused Therapy Skills

**Response 4 — to Advanced Client Statement 4**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-evaluative (catastrophizing/worry) split.4] Wow, that does sound like a lot of worrying. It must be very overwhelming. And maybe even paralyzing. How about if we work with this a little, so we can get a sense of how you worry yourself? Can we try something with the chairs? [asks the client to sit in the other chair set up across from them] I want you to imagine yourself over there, [points back to the original chair the client was sitting in] and just try to get an image or a picture, and I want you to worry yourself now. How do you do that? What do you tell yourself? I want you to actually do it now. Worry her. What would you say? “Your kids are not going to be okay, something terrible will happen to them”? “Maybe you have cancer and you will die in the next 6 months”? Try doing it now.

**Response 5 — to Advanced Client Statement 5**

[The therapist recognizes a marker of a self-interruptive split.] So it is hard to imagine actually saying “I hate you” to your father even if you know it is an imaginary dialogue and he is not really here and you would not have to say it in real life. Let’s work on it a little though to get a sense of how you stop yourself from allowing or expressing your actual feelings to your father. [Brings the client to the chair across from the one they are sitting in] Can you look over to this chair [points back to the other chair across from the client] and imagine yourself over there and try telling yourself not to be angry? What do you say to this part of you? “Don’t be angry,” “Don’t let it out,” “You mustn’t be angry.” Really make a case for why he should not get angry with his father. 4. The catastr ophizing/worry-split is a particular form of a the self-critical/self-evaluative split that is often used with anxious clients who worry and pressure themselves very strongly. The goal of such a dialogue is to understand and take ownership for how the person creates their own worry and anxiety as a way of taking hold of it. The worry dialogue eventually evolves into a self-critical dialogue where the person becomes aware of how they are criticizing and weakening themselves. Eventually, they are able to fight back and transform the critic, leading to self-assertion, self-support, and compassionate self-soothing.

## EXERCISE 12. Addressing Ruptures and Facilitating Repair

### Beginner — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Distrustful ] Sometimes I think I see you getting bored with me. I know I repeat myself a lot, but I want you to pay attention to what I say.

**Statement 2.** [Worried ] My previous therapist asked me about my feelings a lot, and it never helped. One day I got so upset, she had to send me to the hospital. I’d really prefer that we don’t talk about my feelings.

**Statement 3.** [Hesitant ] I see you are student therapist. Do you think you have enough experience to help me?

**Statement 4.** [Guilty ] We’ve been meeting for a few months, but I’m honestly not feeling any better. I think maybe I am doing therapy wrong. What do you think?

### Beginner — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Beginner Client Statement 1**

Thank you for bringing this to my attention! Your reactions to me and our work are extremely important, and I very much appreciate you letting me know. I have not been feeling bored. I find what you say interesting and important. Can I ask you to please let me know when you feel I am not paying attention?

**Response 2 — to Beginner Client Statement 2**

Wow, that must have been really stressful for you. Thank you for letting me know about this. It’s really important. It sounds like talking about feelings has been difficult for you and led you to some pretty deep and distressing places. I can only imagine how hard that must have been. Let’s work out a way together to talk about and focus on what has been painful for you without it leaving you feeling so desperate.

**Response 3 — to Beginner Client Statement 3**

That’s a very common concern, thank you for sharing it. It makes a lot of sense that you’d have some doubts or questions about it. I am a student therapist in training. I am working under supervision of a clinical psychologist. I do hope and believe I can be of help to you, and I’d like to explore your concerns around this, if you think that could be helpful.

**Response 4 — to Beginner Client Statement 4**

I am so glad you are bringing this up so we can discuss it. And I am sorry you have not been feeling any better. I want to let you know that I don’t think there is any such thing as “doing therapy wrong.” Let’s talk about what is not working for you and what you imagine could be more helpful. There may be something different I could be doing. Addressing Ruptures and Facilitating Repair 145

### Intermediate — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Annoyed ] To be honest, I don’t even see the point of talking about my mother. That was a painful relationship, and I would prefer to just not remember it.

**Statement 2.** [Angry ] You know, last week I got really mad at how you laughed when I told you that story with my father. The one where I sarcastically told him that “I never asked to be born”? I felt like you were laughing at me.

**Statement 3.** [Worried ] Sometimes I feel like you don’t understand me. I am 85 years old. I know that you are a lot younger and still in graduate school. Do you think that you are the right therapist for me?

**Statement 4.** [Ashamed ] I have a feeling that you aren’t really interested in me. You sometimes seem bored or tired. If this is true, please be honest and tell me.

### Intermediate — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Intermediate Client Statement 1**

Yeah, it was such a difficult relationship in so many ways, and I imagine your experience of talking about it in the past didn’t feel very productive. I can really understand why you’d prefer to “not go there.” I also know it is very scary to remember those painful childhood feelings. Although you may not be able to change the past, you can change how you carry those feelings you were left with inside of yourself. You see, our goal really is not to change the past or to change your mother because that is unlikely to happen, but what we can change is some of the heartache you were left with, including feelings of worthlessness and pain.

**Response 2 — to Intermediate Client Statement 2**

I really appreciate you telling me this. I am really sorry that I laughed in that moment. And I understand why you felt badly about it. I know how painful your relationship with your father has been for you. It was a momentary lapse for me, and I didn’t mean to put you down. I am sorry I hurt you. I will make sure to not let it happen again. And I hope that you continue to let me know if I do something that leaves you feeling bad.

**Response 3 — to Intermediate Client Statement 3**

First, thank you so much for letting me know your concern. It makes a lot of sense. And you’re very right—we do have a considerable age difference, and I’m sure I’ve sometimes failed to fully understand your experiences. I imagine this is really frustrating for you. And I’m glad we can talk about it openly. I’m committed to you, and believe I can be of help. What matters most is how you feel, and I want to make sure we take this seriously. If, over time, you don’t feel like I am giving you what you need, I can help you find someone that could be a better fit. In the meantime, I want you to know that I feel I can relate to your stories and struggles. If you feel that I somehow don’t understand something, I hope you can tell me like you did just now.

**Response 4 — to Intermediate Client Statement 4**

I am very pleased you brought this up. I am sorry that I seem tired or bored. I am not aware of feeling that, but I’m sure that’s not a pleasant experience for you. It could very naturally bring up some feelings toward me or our work. It’s really great that you told me. I want you to know that I do feel interest and concern for you. But I think you may have picked up on something important: Sometimes it feels to me that we aren’t talking about the difficult feelings that really brought you here. Does that make sense? Could we maybe talk about those feelings for a bit? 146 Deliberate Practice Exercises for Emotion-Focused Therapy Skills

### Advanced — Client Statements

**Statement 1.** [Stern and angry ] I don’t think this therapy is working for me. Every week I come back and tell you the same thing over and over again, and I just don’t feel like I am making progress. I still feel quite down and depressed. I wonder if, like, I am wasting my time and your time, to be honest.

**Statement 2.** [Very uncomfortable ] This is uncomfortable to ask, but I wonder if you are attracted to me romantically? Last week, when I mentioned that I hooked up with a random guy I met at a bar, you asked me a lot of questions about my sexual relationships. Are you interested in me like that?

### Advanced — Example Therapist Responses

**Response 1 — to Advanced Client Statement 1**

I am sorry you feel that. It must be really hard to feel this cycle each week. And I imagine it leaves you feeling a bit trapped or hopeless. I am so glad you brought that to me. I really feel honored that you are sharing this and risking telling me your truth of your experience. First, I want to be clear that if you ever want to discuss the option of trying another therapist or therapy model, I can help you with a few referrals. From my perspective you have been doing some very courageous and difficult work. I also want to make sure you know that I don’t feel like you are wasting my time. I understand that therapy can be a difficult process, and it sometimes means revisiting painful things more than once. I also think that perhaps it has been hard for you to get to some of those painful feelings because they are both scary and distressing. That is understandable. Now that you are bringing this up, though, if you like, I feel that we can work together to find a way to get down into those feelings.

**Response 2 — to Advanced Client Statement 2**

I really appreciate you bringing this up. And I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable or on the spot. These are sensitive topics, and I appreciate that we can talk about them openly. I’m sure it took a lot of courage on your part to bring this up. I want to tell you directly that I do not have romantic feelings toward you and that for me, this is clearly a professional therapeutic relationship. I asked you questions about your relationship because I felt it was important for me to better understand you and your experience. How do you feel hearing this now? I’d like to talk about it.
