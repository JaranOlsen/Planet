# Case 1 – “Sara” (Easy Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 28 years old
	•	Gender: Female (she/her)
	•	Background: Works as a junior marketing professional; grew up with emotionally distant parents (father was often away on business; mother loving but struggled with depression). Currently living in a city, with a small social circle.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Breakup activated a core loneliness/shame network formed in childhood.
- **Emotional Style:** Overregulated, self-contained; suppresses sadness/anger, minimizes and rationalizes.
- **Defenses (common):** Overregulated, self-contained; suppresses sadness/anger, minimizes and rationalizes. People-pleasing, avoidance, and intellectualization (analyzing the breakup rather than feeling). Often apologizes for tears, smiles through pain, and preemptively ends relationships to avoid being left.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Sara comes to therapy reporting feelings of emptiness and depression following a recent breakup. She describes persistent loneliness, low mood, and tearfulness. On the surface, she identifies the breakup with her long-term boyfriend as the cause of her distress. She says she “can’t get over” the loss and fears being alone. She also notes difficulty sleeping, reduced appetite, and trouble concentrating at work since the separation. Friends have commented that she seems unusually withdrawn. Initially, Sara frames her problem as heartbreak and expresses hope that therapy will help her “move on” or possibly win her ex back.

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Beneath the situational sadness of the breakup lies a deep-seated loneliness and shame-based belief that she is unlovable ￼. Sara’s emotional pain centers on a fear of abandonment and sadness of isolation – feelings that long predate her recent breakup. Growing up with a frequently absent father and an overwhelmed mother, Sara learned the maladaptive belief that when people get close, they eventually leave or disengage. This core maladaptive emotion scheme can be summarized as: “If I am not perfect or needed, I will be left behind because I am not worthy of love.” Whenever a relationship ends or someone pulls away, it triggers an old, painful sense of diminished self-worth. She feels defective and “not enough,” reflecting a shame-based feeling of personal inadequacy ￼. This leaves her in intense emotional pain, as though each loss confirms an internal narrative that she is fundamentally unlovable.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Processing Style: Sara generally appears composed and self-contained, which reflects a tendency toward overregulation of emotion. She has difficulty openly expressing hurt or anger; instead, she keeps painful feelings tightly controlled. For example, during sessions she often forces a sad smile or quickly says “I’m fine” while wiping away tears. This suggests she habitually suppresses vulnerable emotions (like sadness or fear) in order to cope. Sara’s style is to rationalize and minimize: she tells herself others have it worse and that she “shouldn’t be so emotional.” This defensive minimization protects her from fully feeling her core pain.

Defenses and Coping: Sara’s primary coping mechanisms include avoidance and people-pleasing. She avoids burdening others with her problems, and friends describe her as the “strong one” who never asks for help. When upset, she tends to isolate herself and throw herself into work or busy tasks to distract from pain. Another defense is her tendency to intellectualize – in early sessions, she analyzes the timeline of the breakup or her ex-partner’s behavior rather than exploring her own feelings. By staying in her head, she distances from the vulnerable hurt in her heart. Additionally, Sara has a habit of preemptively ending relationships at the first sign of conflict in the past, which is a protective maneuver to avoid the pain of being left. Overall, her emotional style is restrained and cautious: she yearns for closeness but is guarded, fearing the very intimacy she seeks.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: By the middle phase of therapy, a clear picture has emerged of how Sara’s breakup triggered a longstanding core schema of emotional deprivation. The therapy process revealed that Sara’s depression is not only grief over her ex-boyfriend, but also a resurfacing of abandonment pain rooted in childhood. We uncovered poignant early memories – for instance, as a child Sara would wait by the window for her father to return from business trips, and felt a stab of sorrow when he wouldn’t come to say goodnight. Such experiences taught her that love can vanish at any moment. Now, in adulthood, her core maladaptive belief is that those she loves will inevitably leave, and that it must be due to her not being “good enough.” The breakup acted as a trigger that activated this dysfunctional belief network.

In therapy, Sara has identified that beneath her conscious sadness lies a profound primary maladaptive emotion of shame-laced loneliness – a sense of being inherently unworthy of lasting love ￼. This feeling was previously unnamed and avoided. Sara also recognizes secondary reactions that complicate her emotional experience: for example, she often feels guilty for being sad (believing she is “burdening others”), which is a secondary reactive emotion that obscures her core loneliness. Through empathic exploration, we have connected Sara’s symptoms (depression, withdrawal) to this internal narrative of unlovability. The case formulation thus holds that Sara’s presenting depression stems from the activation of a core loneliness and shame from early attachment injuries. Her life history of emotional distance in her family set up a template where any loss reactivates that raw pain. Now she can see that her intense despair over the breakup is in part the echo of a little girl who felt emotionally forgotten. Realizing this has helped Sara start to differentiate the old wound from the current situation.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Masked by Initial Presentation: At the start of therapy, Sara’s core issues were well concealed by her focus on the recent breakup and her outward self-blame for its failure. She presented as a straightforward case of acute heartbreak, often saying things like, “If I hadn’t been so needy, he wouldn’t have left.” This self-critical narrative acted as a defense against deeper vulnerability – it was easier for Sara to criticize herself for specific behaviors than to touch the more painful belief that she is fundamentally unlovable. Additionally, her polite, accommodating demeanor in sessions and tendency to say “I understand why he left” masked an underlying well of anger and hurt. She was initially blocked from accessing primary emotions; whenever sadness surfaced, she would quickly apologize for crying or change the topic to something superficial (a classic deflection from core pain).

Defensive Blocks: Sara’s people-pleasing and rationalizing were active in early sessions, blocking the therapeutic process from immediately accessing her core. For example, when the therapist gently probed about her childhood or deeper feelings, Sara would often respond with a smiling, “Oh, my childhood was fine. My parents did their best.” This automatic defense of her parents and reluctance to explore childhood wounds kept the conversation on safe, surface ground. Moreover, her strong need to appear “okay” meant she initially framed therapy as getting practical advice to win her ex back, rather than exploring her feelings. In essence, Sara’s long-cultivated independence and emotional self-control served as a wall, hiding the frightened, lonely inner child who believed she wasn’t worthy of care. Over time, as trust built, these defenses softened and the hidden core schema – the pain of feeling unloved – gradually came into focus. The therapist’s consistent empathy and focus on Sara’s poignant remarks (like the ache of waiting for her dad’s attention) helped illuminate how the presenting problem of breakup grief was a doorway into much older emotional injuries that Sara had been warding off behind a facade of self-reliance.

# Case2 – “Michael” (Easy Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 35 years old
	•	Gender: Male (he/him)
	•	Background: Middle manager at a tech company. Raised in a family with high expectations – his father was a military officer who was often critical and rarely showed affection. Michael is married with one young child. No history of therapy; sought counseling at his wife’s urging due to anger issues.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Trigger (criticism) → core shame/fear → defensive rage → consequences (conflict/guilt) → reinforced shame. Anger shields a wounded child who fears being small/defective. Linking past humiliations to present flares builds insight; acknowledging hurt reduces reactivity.
- **Emotional Style:** Low tolerance for vulnerability; overregulated sadness/fear, underregulated anger.
- **Defenses (common):** Low tolerance for vulnerability; overregulated sadness/fear, underregulated anger. Externalization, projection/blame, perfectionism, minimization, and rationalization. Mild after-work drinking.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Michael reports frequent anger outbursts and irritability, primarily at work and occasionally at home. He describes getting “triggered” by what he perceives as incompetence or criticism – for example, if a coworker makes a mistake, he finds himself yelling, and if his wife questions his decisions, he becomes defensive and snaps at her. Michael’s presenting concerns include: nearly getting written up at work for an explosive argument with a colleague, and tension in his marriage (his wife says he “flies off the handle” over minor issues). He initially frames the problem as stress management, saying he’s under a lot of pressure and that people around him “don’t do things right,” which frustrates him. He acknowledges his temper is hurting his relationships but struggles to control it, often feeling regret afterwards. At intake, Michael denied any depression or anxiety, focusing solely on his anger. He was somewhat skeptical about therapy, saying “I’m just not the kind of guy who talks about feelings, but I’ll give it a try for my wife.”

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Beneath Michael’s quick anger lies a well of shame and inadequacy that he has carried since childhood. At the core, Michael operates under a maladaptive schema: “I am never good enough; I am fundamentally flawed.” This core belief formed in response to years of harsh criticism from his father. As a boy, when Michael brought home a 90% test score, his father would ask, “Why not 100%?” or call him “soft” if he showed sadness. These experiences instilled a deep shame-based feeling of diminishment – an enduring sense of not measuring up and being unworthy in the eyes of those he most wanted approval from ￼. The emotional pain associated with this schema is profound: Michael feels a lingering (often unconscious) hurt and fear of rejection. Specifically, he dreads being seen as weak or incompetent because that taps into his core fear of being fundamentally inadequate. Thus, the primary maladaptive emotion driving Michael’s difficulties is shame. It’s coupled with a fear that if he is inadequate, he will be humiliated or abandoned (in an emotional sense) by others – a fear dating back to childhood experiences of emotional unavailability from his father.

Maladaptive Emotion Scheme: Michael’s core shame and fear have coalesced into a reactive pattern: when something happens that touches this old wound (for instance, being corrected or not having the answer immediately), it triggers intense discomfort. Because the raw feeling of “I’m not good enough” is so painful and threatening to his identity, his psyche has organized to defend against it at all costs. The result is a maladaptive anger scheme: anger surges automatically to cover the underlying hurt. In EFT terms, Michael’s anger is a secondary reactive emotion – a response that obscures the more vulnerable primary feelings of shame and fear ￼. The anger has a protective function: it wards off the dreaded feeling of powerlessness that shame brings. Unfortunately, this entrenched pattern prevents him from validating or processing the core pain; instead, it often creates exactly the situations he fears (e.g., alienating others, inviting more criticism due to his outbursts).

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: Michael’s emotional style is characterized by low tolerance for vulnerability and a tendency to externalize feelings. He is not comfortable with sadness, fear, or any emotion he views as “weak.” In sessions, he maintains a stoic demeanor – arms crossed, jaw tight – especially when conversations verge on sensitive areas like his childhood. This suggests he is overregulated regarding vulnerable affects (keeping a tight lid on them). In contrast, he is underregulated with anger: he allows it to erupt quickly with little filter. Thus, his emotional regulation is imbalanced – overcontrolled in some domains and undercontrolled in others. Michael also processes experience in a very task-oriented, cognitive way. When asked about feelings, he often talks about “figuring out the solution” or what someone did wrong, rather than how he felt. This cognitive bias serves as a defensive distancing from raw emotion.

Defensive Coping Mechanisms: Michael’s primary defenses include projection and blame, perfectionism, and minimization. Instead of feeling his own hurt or fear of not being good enough, he often projects incompetence or blame onto others (“My team is full of idiots,” “If people weren’t so lazy, I wouldn’t lose my temper”). This externalization protects him from facing inadequacy internally. His perfectionism – holding both himself and others to unrealistically high standards – is another defense; it’s as if by demanding perfection, he hopes to never feel the shame of failure. Of course, this backfires and keeps him in a cycle of constant disappointment. Additionally, Michael minimizes the impact of his father’s criticism. Early on, he would say things like, “Yeah, Dad was hard on me, but that made me strong – it’s not a big deal.” This downplaying is a way to avoid acknowledging the painful emotional injury he actually incurred. He also uses rationalization to justify his anger (e.g., “Anyone would’ve blown up in that situation, it’s normal to yell when employees mess up”). Privately, Michael sometimes copes by having a few drinks after a hard day (a mild form of self-medicating his stress), though he doesn’t identify this as a problem. All these defenses – blaming others, striving for flawlessness, and denying pain – function to keep his core shame at bay, albeit at significant cost to his emotional well-being and relationships.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Conceptualization: By mid-therapy, Michael and the therapist have developed a shared understanding of the cycle underlying his anger problems. We conceptualize that Michael’s presenting anger outbursts are the visible tip of the iceberg, while below the surface lies a classic shame-based identity wound. Whenever Michael perceives criticism or failure (trigger), it resonates with his childhood narrative of inadequacy, evoking a flash of primary pain – a mix of shame and fear. This feeling is almost instantaneous and largely unconscious; Michael often wasn’t even aware of feeling hurt because his anger flares so quickly in response. We have identified that his anger is serving as a protective shield: it’s easier for him to feel angry (and momentarily “strong”) than to feel the small, ashamed boy inside. Unfortunately, this protection is a double-edged sword: while it guards him from conscious shame in the moment, it leads to behavior that causes guilt and further threatens his self-esteem later.

In therapy, Michael has been able to recall and process a few key childhood incidents – for example, being publicly scolded by his father at a Little League game. In those memories, he recognizes feelings of humiliation, fear, and intense sadness that he “wasn’t good enough” in his dad’s eyes. Linking past to present, Michael can see that the rage he unleashes at a junior coworker over a minor mistake is not really about that mistake – it’s fueled by the old hurt of being made to feel small and worthless. The case formulation thus centers on the insight that anger is a secondary reaction obscuring a wounded inner child who believes he is fundamentally deficient ￼. We also identified a related maladaptive belief: “If I show any weakness or let people get the better of me, I’ll be ashamed and abandoned.” This belief drives a hyper-vigilance for disrespect – he’s constantly on guard for cues that someone might be thinking he’s not competent. Ironically, this vigilance creates misunderstandings; he interprets neutral comments as attacks, triggering the very cycle he hopes to avoid.

At this stage, Michael has started to acknowledge the emotional cost of this pattern. He can now articulate that after he explodes in anger, underneath the immediate guilt, he actually feels a familiar despair – the same despair of that little boy who thinks “I’ve failed again; I’m awful.” This awareness is a significant step. The formulation we’ve agreed on is: a trigger (criticism or stress) → core shame/pain of inadequacy → defensive anger outburst → negative consequences (conflict, guilt) reinforcing shame. Understanding this sequence in the context of his life history has opened Michael to working on the real issues rather than simply trying to “manage anger” superficially.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Initial Concealment: When Michael began therapy, his core issues were camouflaged by his externalizing focus and skepticism of emotional exploration. He walked into the first session declaring, “I just have an anger problem because people are stupid. I don’t see what my childhood has to do with it.” His insistence that the problem lay “out there” – with stressful circumstances or others’ failings – acted as a barrier to seeing the internal wounds driving his reactions. Michael’s identity as a tough, self-reliant person also made it hard for him to show any vulnerability. In early sessions, whenever the conversation drifted toward hurt or fear, he would make a joke, change topic, or grow visibly uncomfortable and revert to complaining about work. This was a sign of emotional avoidance: he was far more comfortable recounting incidents that angered him than describing times he felt small or scared.

Defensive Blocking: Michael’s defenses actively blocked access to his core shame initially. For instance, when asked how he felt when his boss gave him feedback that his report wasn’t up to par, Michael defaulted to describing how wrong the boss was or how he then argued – he completely skipped over the feelings the feedback evoked. This intellectualization and blame-shifting hid the moment of hurt where his core belief (“I failed, I’m not good enough”) was likely activated. Furthermore, his minimization of childhood experiences (saying things like “My dad was strict, but I needed it”) kept the therapy from immediately delving into those formative events. It was as if a protective lock was placed on any discussion of his father or past – a sign of how threatening that territory was to him.

Additionally, Michael’s quickness to anger even within sessions at times served as a defense. For example, when the therapist gently suggested that his father’s criticism might still be affecting him, Michael bristled and tersely replied, “So you’re saying this is all my dad’s fault? That’s ridiculous.” His defensiveness in the therapy room mirrored his everyday pattern – using anger to push away a perceived challenge. This reaction momentarily ruptured the therapeutic alliance, requiring careful repair and reassurance that we were exploring patterns, not blaming. Over time, as Michael felt more understood and less judged, these defensive reactions softened. He began to cautiously express not just anger but also pain, allowing the hidden core – the long-suppressed feelings of inadequacy and hurt – to slowly emerge into the therapeutic dialogue. The cracking of his tough façade was gradual, but each time Michael managed to stay with a vulnerable emotion a bit longer (for instance, admitting, “I guess it did hurt when my boss said that”), it chipped away at the defensive wall that had kept his true feelings hidden for so long.

# Case3 – “Jason” (Easy Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 24 years old
	•	Gender: Male (he/him)
	•	Background: Recent college graduate working in his first corporate job. Grew up as an only child in a middle-class family; describes parents as “loving but anxious.” He was shy and academically gifted in school but struggled socially, experiencing some bullying in middle school. Currently single and living alone.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Social anxiety is an echo of past ridicule and attachment pain.
- **Emotional Style:** Overcontrolled/inhibited; emotional shutdown in interpersonal settings; alexithymic tendencies.
- **Defenses (common):** Overcontrolled/inhibited; emotional shutdown in interpersonal settings; alexithymic tendencies. Avoidance, masking, safety behaviors, hyper self-monitoring; harsh internal critic.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Jason seeks therapy for severe social anxiety and feelings of isolation. He reports intense anxiety in social and professional settings – for example, in meetings at work his heart races and mind goes blank if he has to speak, and he avoids social gatherings with colleagues. Jason says he feels “invisible” and “paralyzed” around others, and this has led to loneliness and mild depressive feelings (e.g., hopeless thoughts like “I’ll always be alone”). The immediate catalyst for seeking help was a recent incident where he had a panic episode while giving a brief presentation at work; he’s now terrified it will happen again. In describing his problem, Jason focuses on symptoms: sweating, stammering, “overthinking everything I say.” He also frequently uses negative self-statements like “I’m awkward,” “I’m boring,” indicating low self-esteem. Initially, he identifies the problem as anxiety that he can’t control, saying “My nerves ruin everything. I just want to feel normal and confident around people.” He has no significant physical health issues; he does mention occasional drinking to calm his nerves (having a beer before social events), but no serious substance use.

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Underneath Jason’s social anxiety lies a deep maladaptive shame – a belief that “There’s something wrong with me; I’m fundamentally defective or unlikable.” This core shame is the emotional pain that fuels his anxiety. From an EFT perspective, Jason’s relentless fear in social situations is not just fear of specific scenarios but rooted in a core schema of defectiveness and rejection. As a child, Jason was frequently teased by peers for being “weird” or “too quiet,” and he internalized those judgments. He also had well-meaning but overly anxious parents who often jumped in to “help” him, inadvertently sending the message that he couldn’t handle things on his own. Over time, these experiences crystallized into a primary maladaptive emotion of shame – he feels flawed and not good enough for others’ acceptance. Alongside shame is profound fear: fear of being judged, ridiculed, or abandoned if his true self is seen. This fear is an attachment-related terror of not belonging or being valued. Thus, the pain driving Jason’s problems is the sadness and fear of loneliness and rejection, and a shameful certainty that any rejection is justified because he’s “not worth” caring about.

Maladaptive Emotion Scheme: The above core feelings form a self-reinforcing emotional scheme. The scheme operates something like: “If I reveal myself, people will see how worthless I am and reject me.” This belief triggers intense social fear (a form of primary maladaptive anxiety tied to shame). To Jason, every social interaction unconsciously poses the threat of exposing his perceived defectiveness. Over years, this has become a habitual emotional schema – any scenario of being seen or evaluated (like speaking up, meeting new people) automatically activates bodily anxiety (racing heart, etc.), catastrophic thoughts (“They’ll think I’m stupid”), and overwhelming shame. In essence, his core maladaptive shame and fear constitute an emotional memory of past humiliations, which gets generalized to most social contexts. Notably, Jason’s maladaptive scheme is self-perpetuating: his anxious behaviors (avoiding eye contact, speaking quietly or not at all) sometimes do lead others to overlook or misunderstand him, which then “confirms” his belief that he’s socially inept or unworthy. It’s a painful loop rooted in this core emotional wound.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: Jason tends toward an overcontrolled, inhibited emotional style in interpersonal contexts. He’s highly attuned to potential negative evaluation, which results in him shutting down emotionally around others. For instance, in sessions, when asked about how he felt during a social situation, he often struggles to identify feelings beyond “nervous.” It appears he’s so accustomed to avoiding or numbing emotions in social contexts that he has difficulty accessing them even in the safer environment of therapy. His affect is generally flat or anxious; he rarely expresses anger or strong joy, indicating he habitually suppresses expressive emotion to avoid drawing attention. Internally, Jason is very self-critical and ruminative – his mind is constantly analyzing his every word or action (“Did I sound dumb? Did I offend them by how I said hello?”). This internal critic dominates his emotional landscape, leaving little room for spontaneous or adaptive emotional experience.

Defensive Coping Mechanisms: To cope with his intense fear of rejection, Jason uses avoidance as a primary defense. He avoids initiating conversations, avoids speaking up even when he has good ideas, and has turned down invitations to social events – all in an effort to prevent the dreaded scenario of being judged or embarrassed. This avoidance, while providing short-term relief, reinforces his isolation and maintains his belief that he can’t handle social situations. Another coping mechanism is masking – when he cannot avoid an interaction, Jason tries hard to conceal any signs of anxiety or emotion, attempting to appear “normal.” He might force a brief smile or give very short responses to avoid saying anything wrong. Essentially, he emotionally freezes (which is a form of the “flight-or-freeze” response to perceived social danger). Additionally, Jason engages in safety behaviors: for example, he meticulously rehearses what he’ll say ahead of meetings, or he clutches his phone as a security object in public settings. These behaviors are defensive – they’re meant to ward off humiliation. Cognitive defenses are at play too: he constantly self-monitors and critiques himself in real time, which paradoxically impairs his ability to connect naturally. If he stumbles on a word, his inner voice screams “You see, you messed up again,” which then escalates his anxiety. This inner critic is effectively an internalized bullying voice, and listening to it is a way Jason preempts external criticism by beating himself up first. In summary, Jason’s defenses (avoidance, emotional suppression, hypervigilant self-critique) serve to protect him from feeling the shame of possible rejection – but they also trap him in the very loneliness and low self-worth he fears.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: By mid-phase of therapy, Jason and the therapist have pieced together a compassionate understanding of how his social anxiety is rooted in early emotional injuries. The formulation recognizes that Jason’s intense anxiety in the present is actually the echo of past experiences of rejection and ridicule. When he’s in a situation like speaking in a meeting, it’s not just a 24-year-old in a conference room – psychologically, it’s also the 13-year-old boy on the school bus being laughed at for his stammer, or the child whose parents told him to “just not care what others think” (which he couldn’t achieve, leading him to feel broken for being sensitive). Thus, the core maladaptive emotions at play are shame and fear. The shame whispers, “Everyone can see you’re a fraud or loser,” and the fear shouts, “You’ll be rejected if you make one wrong move.” We understand now that these feelings stem from a deeply ingrained sense of defectiveness that Jason developed. Therapy has highlighted how this core belief was formed and reinforced: small incidents (like a classmate rolling their eyes when he talked) were interpreted through a lens of “it’s because I’m awkward,” solidifying his negative self-image.

The case formulation identifies Jason’s secondary processes as well. We see that on top of primary shame/fear, Jason often experiences secondary emotions like frustration with himself (“Why am I like this?”) and despair (“I’ll always be alone”). These secondary reactions, especially self-anger and hopelessness, further obscure the primary pain by turning his aggression inward instead of understanding the hurt beneath. A crucial part of the formulation is recognizing Jason’s interruptive processes – namely, his avoidance and self-criticism – as mechanisms that block healing. Each time a core feeling tries to emerge (say, sadness at feeling left out), his critic pounces (“Stop feeling sorry for yourself”) or he distracts himself with video games. By mid-therapy, Jason can see that these processes, while intended to protect him, actually maintain his problem by not allowing him to fully process or challenge his core beliefs.

In narrative form, our formulation might say: Jason’s long-standing belief of being unlikable and defective was formed through experiences of social pain. This belief now triggers intense anxiety (fear of judgment) and profound shame in any context where others’ opinions matter. To cope, Jason withdraws or overanalyzes, which unfortunately keeps him lonely and convinces him even more that he’s incapable socially. The more lonely and self-critical he becomes, the stronger the belief in defectiveness grows, in a self-reinforcing loop. We have also noted that Jason’s anxiety has an almost protective intent – it’s as if a part of him (the anxious, worrying part) is trying to keep him safe from harm by anticipating every possible social misstep. Understanding this “worry part” as trying to help has given Jason some distance from it.

At this stage, Jason has begun to recall specific memories in session that carry emotional weight (for example, the day a friend abruptly stopped talking to him in high school). As he recounts these, he often softens into sadness – a primary emotion that had been hidden under anxiety. This is a sign we are reaching the core pain: the sadness of loneliness and feeling unimportant. Our formulation holds that transforming this core sadness and the accompanying shame is key to reducing the anxiety. In summary, the mid-phase understanding is that Jason’s social anxiety is not a mysterious uncontrollable illness, but a logical outcome of his life experiences – a learned fear response to human connection – and that at its heart lies a wounded self that believes it is unworthy of love unless it is perfect or invisible.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Initial Masks and Blocks: When Jason first started therapy, his focus was almost entirely on the symptoms of anxiety (heart rate, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors) rather than the feelings or beliefs underlying them. He genuinely did not realize that emotional pain from the past was driving these symptoms. His core shame was hidden behind layers of automatic negative thoughts and anxious rumination. Initially, any attempt by the therapist to explore feelings of hurt or sadness was met with Jason’s confusion or blankness – he was so used to immediately turning anxiety or criticism on himself that he wasn’t in touch with softer feelings. For instance, early on the therapist asked, “How do you feel when you imagine speaking up and others might judge you?” Jason replied with something cognitive like, “I feel like I just can’t do it; my mind goes blank.” It took gentle probing to realize that beneath “blank” was terror and beneath that terror was a belief, “They’ll see I’m worthless.” But at first, Jason didn’t volunteer that thought – it was deeply buried. His internal critic effectively gatekept his deeper emotions, pouncing in with “Stop whining, it’s not a big deal” whenever a vulnerable feeling tried to surface, thus hiding the core issues.

Defenses in Early Sessions: Jason’s avoidance carried into the therapy room in subtle ways. When topics got close to his core pain (e.g. discussing childhood friendships or his parents’ expectations), he would often divert the conversation to something trivial or intellectual. He might suddenly bring up a unrelated detail (“Oh, that reminds me, I read an article about anxiety…”) to steer away from feelings. This kind of intellectualization and distraction was a defense that kept truly painful material at bay. Additionally, his ingrained habit of people-pleasing meant he was very agreeable in sessions but would shy away from expressing any strong emotion that might be judged. He would often say what he thought he should say, rather than dropping into what he actually felt. This made it challenging to access authentic emotion initially.

Moreover, Jason’s long practice of emotional numbing in social contexts didn’t immediately turn off in therapy. It was as if he had an “emotional mute” button that automatically engaged in presence of another person (even a therapist). Early on, he frequently said “I don’t know” when asked about feelings, not to be evasive, but because he truly had difficulty recognizing and articulating them – a mild form of alexithymia stemming from chronic avoidance of emotion ￼. All these factors hid the core issues (shame, loneliness) underneath a presentation of “anxiety problems.”

As trust developed, these protective layers started peeling back. Jason began to feel that the therapy space was nonjudgmental enough that he wouldn’t be ridiculed. Small breakthroughs, such as tearfully admitting “I feel like I’ll always be alone” in one session, revealed glimpses of the raw pain that had been there all along. That moment – which came only after earlier sessions where he danced around that admission – illustrated how initially the core sadness and shame were blocked by fear and self-censorship, but with patience and empathic safety, Jason could finally voice the very feelings that had been driving his anxiety from the shadows.

# Case4 – “Laura” (Moderate Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 45 years old
	•	Gender: Female (she/her)
	•	Background: Works as a nurse. Divorced, with two adult children who live out of state. Laura grew up in a chaotic home; her father was physically abusive and her mother, although not abusive herself, was emotionally distant and frequently in denial about the abuse. Laura has a history of chronic low-grade depression (dysthymia) and some features of Complex PTSD from childhood trauma.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Depression as frozen grief/terror; childhood trauma schema fuels avoidance that maintains emptiness and relational distance.
- **Emotional Style:** Overregulated/numb with dissociative episodes; occasional panic surges.
- **Defenses (common):** Overregulated/numb with dissociative episodes; occasional panic surges. Avoidance, minimization/rationalization, intellectualization, self-medication, withdrawal, hypervigilance.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Laura enters therapy describing a long-term depression and sense of numbness. She says, “I feel empty and detached from everyone – even my kids.” Her depressive symptoms include low energy, persistent flat mood, trouble sleeping through the night, and an overall lack of joy or interest in activities she used to enjoy. She also reports episodes of intense anxiety, particularly in situations of conflict or when she hears raised voices (for example, she panicked and had to leave a movie theater during a scene of domestic violence). Laura’s immediate reasons for seeking therapy are twofold: her depression has worsened since her divorce two years ago, and she finds herself unable to form new close relationships – she hasn’t dated since the divorce and has been withdrawing from friends. She acknowledges a lifelong pattern of emotional withdrawal: “I’ve always found it hard to trust people or to feel much when I’m with them.” She expresses feeling stuck and says she’s tired of “living behind a wall.” On intake, Laura downplays her traumatic past, remarking that “others had it worse” and insisting her childhood is long over. She frames her current problem as possibly biological (“maybe I just have a chemical imbalance”) and circumstantial (“empty nest and divorce blues”). However, she does note with concern that she sometimes drinks wine nightly to “turn off” her racing thoughts or on-edge feelings, suggesting a mild self-medicating pattern.

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Underneath Laura’s numb depression lies profound emotional pain rooted in childhood abuse and neglect. The central pain has two major components: fear and shame. As a child, Laura lived in sustained fear of her father’s outbursts – he would unpredictably beat her with little provocation. Concurrently, she developed a core belief that “I must be bad or unworthy of love for my own parent to hurt me.” This translates into deep shame. In EFT terms, Laura carries a core maladaptive fear of betrayal and harm (an attachment insecurity) paired with a core maladaptive shame of being fundamentally defective ￼ ￼. Emotional pain from these core states is immense: it’s the terror and lonely helplessness of a child who had no safe refuge, and the heartbreak and sadness of abandonment by the mother who didn’t protect her. Over the years, these feelings became encapsulated in a maladaptive emotion scheme: “Anyone close to me will hurt or abandon me, and it’s because I am not worth caring for.” When her marriage ended (her husband had not been abusive, but leaving the marriage triggered old abandonment wounds), this scheme was reactivated, flooding her with the old pain of being unwanted.

At her core, Laura feels unlovable and unsafe. Importantly, her shame is not just about the past abuse events – it’s an enduring sense of self as “damaged goods.” She has painful memories (somewhat dissociated) of cowering in her room after beatings, feeling utterly alone, terrified, and convinced she was bad. These experiences formed a pathogenic emotion memory, one that remains alive in her psyche. The result is that Laura’s baseline emotional state is colored by a faint echo of that childhood pain: persistent emptiness (numbness as a defense against terror) and underlying sorrow and fear that she generally blocks from awareness.

Maladaptive Emotion Scheme: Laura’s maladaptive emotion scheme can be described as an abuse survivor schema. It includes expectations like “People who say they care will eventually hurt me” and “If I show weakness or need, I’ll be humiliated or rejected.” The primary maladaptive emotions here are fear (of closeness, which equates to danger) and shame (believing she provoked or deserved the abuse) ￼. This schema was learned directly in her formative relationships – her caregiver, who should have been her source of safety, was instead the source of harm, creating a confusing emotional paradox ￼. Because the person she would turn to for comfort (her mother) was also absent or invalidating, Laura learned that expressing pain got her nowhere, maybe even made things worse. Over time, she adapted by shutting down emotionally. This became part of the scheme: feeling nothing (or very little) became safer than feeling terror or longing that would be unmet. The maladaptive belief “I am powerless and alone” became central.

Now, in adulthood, this scheme is triggered by situations that even remotely resemble the themes of her trauma. When her ex-husband left (triggering abandonment), her emotional system went into overdrive fear/shame – she had nightmares of being chased or attacked afterwards, and a crushing sense of worthlessness re-emerged. Even smaller triggers, like a friend not calling her back, can unconsciously activate that schema: her body might respond with anxiety, and her mind with “Here it comes – I’ll be left; I can’t trust anyone.” But because these feelings are so threatening, her psyche often responds by immediately numbing out, which is why she presents as emotionally flat and “doesn’t feel much.” In summary, Laura’s underlying maladaptive scheme is one of insecure attachment and trauma: connection equals danger, and her self is defective and to blame. This scheme generates chronic maladaptive emotions (dread, shame, forlorn grief) that she then pushes away to survive.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: Laura’s emotional style is marked by emotional over-regulation and dissociation. Decades of living with trauma have made her an expert in numbing her feelings. She describes feeling “empty” or “like I’m behind glass, watching life happen.” This indicates a dissociative tendency – not full blackouts, but a frequent detachment from present-moment emotions and bodily sensations. In therapy sessions, when approaching painful topics, Laura’s eyes glaze over and she reports feeling distant or unreal (a mild dissociative response). She rarely cries or raises her voice; her affect stays remarkably flat even when discussing objectively disturbing experiences. This over-regulated style is a learned survival strategy: by dampening all emotion, she protects herself from being overwhelmed by terror or grief ￼. However, it also means she struggles to experience positive emotions like joy or love with any intensity.

Notably, despite her calm exterior, Laura has moments of underregulated emotion in the form of panic symptoms and startled reactions. For example, if someone grabs her arm unexpectedly or she hears shouting, her heart races and she might shake – her body remembers the fear even if her mind tries to stay detached. So while her baseline is numbness, there’s a reservoir of unprocessed emotion that can flood out in certain situations, leaving her feeling out of control. Generally, though, her emotional profile is one of constriction: she lives in a narrow band of affect because anything outside that band (especially intense vulnerability) threatens to overwhelm her carefully maintained control.

Defensive Coping Mechanisms: Laura’s psyche employs several defenses to keep her emotional pain at bay. The primary one is emotional avoidance, both external and internal. Externally, she avoids situations that might trigger her, such as intimate relationships or conflict. She’s chosen a lifestyle of relative isolation (aside from work) because closeness is scary. Internally, she avoids by dissociating – when distressing feelings start to surface, she goes numb or mentally “checks out.” She has described feeling like a “robot” going through the motions of life, which is indicative of a longstanding avoidance of feeling. Another key defense is minimization and rationalization of her trauma. For years, she told herself “It wasn’t that bad” or “Other kids had it worse than me,” which downplays the significance of what happened. This served to help her cope as a child (believing “it’s not a big deal” was easier than facing the horror), and she carried it into adulthood as a way to not fully acknowledge her pain.

Laura also uses substance use (wine in the evenings) as a form of self-medication – it blunts what anxiety or intrusive memories do break through at night. Additionally, she has a strong tendency towards withdrawal under stress: her instinct is to physically retreat and be alone whenever she feels upset, which is a continuation of how she hid in her room as a child. In therapy, an observed defense is intellectualization: she sometimes speaks about her experiences in a detached, story-like way, as if it happened to someone else, or she’ll focus on factual details (dates, what bruises she had) rather than how she felt. This cognitive approach distances her from the emotional content. Finally, hypervigilance can be seen as both a symptom and a defense; she’s always scanning for potential danger (e.g., noting people’s tones of voice carefully) – by anticipating threats, she feels a modicum of control, which defends against the original feeling of helplessness. All these mechanisms – numbing, avoiding, minimizing, intellectualizing, self-medicating – function to block the raw terror, hurt, and shame that Laura still carries, because on some level she believes truly facing those feelings would be unbearable or even make her “lose her mind.”

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: In the mid-phase of therapy, Laura and the therapist have developed a clearer narrative of her difficulties that links present symptoms to past experiences. The formulation can be summarized as chronic, unresolved trauma pain manifesting as depression, emotional numbing, and interpersonal avoidance. We understand now that Laura’s persistent depression (with emptiness and lack of interest) is not a simple mood disorder but is deeply connected to her unaddressed childhood trauma. Specifically, we have identified that at the heart of her emotional shutdown lies a core schema of fear and shame learned in her abusive household ￼. Laura’s psyche concluded, “Being close leads to pain; I am alone and must not feel.” This protected her as a child, but now it imprisons her in loneliness.

Therapy has helped put words to feelings she couldn’t articulate before. For instance, through careful exploration, Laura recognized that beneath her numbness is a well of grief – grief for the childhood care she never got, and grief for the fact that she cannot seem to fully engage with her now-adult children emotionally. We also uncovered intense anger that she had buried (anger at her father for the abuse and at her mother for not intervening). This anger had been converted into depressive symptoms over time, as she directed it inward or shut it down. A pivotal moment in therapy was when Laura recounted a specific memory of hiding in a closet after a beating; as she described it, she for the first time sobbed and said “I was so scared… and she [her mother] just kept washing dishes.” This was the breakthrough of a primary emotion – terror and abandonment sadness – that had been dissociated. Our formulation holds that these very emotions, when unprocessed, congealed into her chronic emptiness. Only by accessing and acknowledging these core feelings (fear, shame, sadness, anger) in a safe way can the depressive fog lift.

We also conceptualize the cycles that maintain her problems. For example, a trigger like potential conflict (say a colleague raises their voice) activates her core fear schema (“I’m in danger”). Her immediate emotional reaction is panic (sweating, heart pounding). Her interruptive process is to numb out or flee (she shuts down in the moment). This prevents new corrective experiences (like learning that not all anger leads to abuse) and leaves her original beliefs unchallenged. After such incidents, she often feels ashamed of her panic, which adds to her belief of being “broken” or “weak” – a secondary process that reinforces her depression ￼. Recognizing this pattern, the formulation emphasizes that Laura’s depression and isolation are maintained by avoidance: by avoiding closeness and emotions, she also avoids any opportunities to disconfirm her belief that all closeness is dangerous, thus keeping her stuck.

The formulation integrates her divorce as well: her husband was actually kind, but she kept emotional distance throughout the marriage (due to fear of vulnerability). Ultimately he left, saying he felt shut out. This event became proof to Laura’s maladaptive schema that “See, I really am unlovable – even a good man left me,” fueling her shame. Understanding this in therapy, Laura could start to see how her fear of being hurt led her to pull away, which then contributed to the very loss she feared. This insight has been painful but crucial. It underscores how her core beliefs became self-fulfilling in some ways.

By mid-therapy, Laura has begun to thaw emotionally in sessions – having moments of real sadness or anger – and each time we connect those moments to aspects of her past (e.g., “That desperation you felt when your mother ignored your pain, that feeling is surfacing now”). She is gradually constructing a narrative that her symptoms are not random or solely “biochemical,” but rather the understandable outcome of a little girl who had to survive terror and now a woman who never got to heal. The coherent case narrative might be: Laura learned early on that love can come with violence and that expressing feelings brings punishment or abandonment. To survive, she erased her emotions and built walls. Now, those walls keep everyone out and keep her own pain in, leading to a life that is safe but empty. Her depression is the cost of keeping all that pain inside, unprocessed. This formulation, which Laura fully participates in, sets the stage for work to gently process the trauma she has been avoiding, with the hope of reclaiming her capacity to feel and connect.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Initial Concealment of Trauma Impact: At the start of therapy, Laura’s core issues were deeply buried under years of avoidance and denial. She presented with a flat affect and a narrative that didn’t immediately point to trauma. In fact, in the very first session, when asked about her childhood, she responded with something like, “It was a long time ago and I don’t think it’s relevant – I’m here because I’m depressed now.” This indicates how her defenses walled off the link between past and present. The true extent of her fear and shame was hidden behind a seemingly “matter-of-fact” recounting of her life. For instance, she mentioned her father’s abuse almost as a footnote, with a blank expression, then quickly shifted to talking about work stress. This emotional detachment was a major obstacle – it was hard for the therapist initially to gauge just how much pain was underneath because Laura showed almost no visible reaction when talking about traumatic events. Her dissociative habit of spacing out made it challenging to keep her engaged on emotionally charged topics; often, she would speak in a monotone and then say “I don’t really remember much detail.” This was a clue that her mind was keeping the door to those memories only half-open.

Defensive Barriers: Laura’s decades of minimizing her trauma also hid the core issues. Early on, she would say things like, “My father had a temper, but you know, it was a different time – people didn’t know better” or “I was a difficult kid, I probably provoked him.” These statements show rationalization and internalized blame – both defenses that not only excused the abuser but also placed responsibility on herself in a distorted way. By adopting these views, Laura avoided feeling the full outrage or hurt about what happened. It also reinforced her shame (since she implicitly blamed herself), but in a way that was familiar and therefore oddly safer than confronting the enormity of her parents’ failures.

In the initial phase, any time the therapist gently pointed toward a possible feeling, Laura would deflect. For example, when asked, “How did it feel when your mother didn’t step in during the abuse?” she might respond, “I’m not sure… It was just normal, I guess. Can we talk about my sleep problems now?” This topic shifting was a sign of discomfort and a method to avoid painful feelings – effectively blocking access to the core issue. Similarly, when her divorce came up, she at first framed it in purely practical terms (“We grew apart”) and brushed aside the heartbreak. Only later did it emerge how abandoned she had felt.

Another subtle way her core pain was hidden: Laura’s presentation of being “high-functioning” and calm made it easy to overlook how much she was suffering internally. She held a steady job, took care of herself, and wasn’t overtly falling apart. This outward stability was in part a defensive facade – a lifetime of being in control to avoid chaos. It made the therapist’s task akin to reading a closed book; the usual emotional signals were muted. It took time and patience to create enough safety for Laura’s protective parts to relax. As trust in the therapeutic relationship grew and we explicitly acknowledged her strengths in surviving, Laura began to allow glimpses of vulnerability. Small cracks appeared: her voice trembled slightly when discussing a memory, or she admitted “Sometimes I wonder if it really was my fault as a kid.” Each of these moments was a sign that the fortress of defense was cautiously lowering its drawbridge, revealing the wounded self within. Initially, however, that fortress – built of numbing, denial, and intellectualization – effectively concealed the raw terror and shame that were driving her depression and isolation ￼. Only by persistently and gently addressing the mismatch (noting that her words described trauma but her affect was flat) did the therapy slowly unlock those hidden core experiences.

# Case5 – “Carlos” (Moderate Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 30 years old
	•	Gender: Male (he/him)
	•	Background: Works as a construction supervisor. Second-generation immigrant (parents from Mexico); grew up in a low-income urban neighborhood. He’s married with one young child. His upbringing was tough – his father was very strict and occasionally physically punitive (“spankings that sometimes went too far”), and the neighborhood was rough with frequent fights. Carlos has no prior therapy experience. He has a history of occasional heavy drinking and one arrest in his early 20s for getting into a bar fight (no charges filed).

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Perceived disrespect → flash of hurt/fear → automatic rage (“sword and shield”). Childhood humiliation and danger mapped onto present minor slights. Breakthroughs reveal longing for acceptance and grief beneath anger; insight into cycle reduces reactivity.
- **Emotional Style:** Underregulated anger; overregulated vulnerability.
- **Defenses (common):** Underregulated anger; overregulated vulnerability. Hyper‑masculine posturing, projection, rationalization/normalization, sarcasm; post‑explosion numbing; alcohol lowers inhibition.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Carlos is prompted to seek therapy after an incident where he punched a hole in a wall during an argument with his wife. He reports intense anger issues that are straining his marriage and could jeopardize his job. “I go from 0 to 100 in a flash,” he says. Presenting concerns include frequent yelling, throwing objects, and getting into shouting matches at work with subcontractors. His wife is afraid he might eventually turn his anger on her or their child (Carlos denies ever hitting them, but acknowledges his outbursts are scary). Carlos describes feeling disrespected or provoked easily: “If someone even looks at me funny or questions me, I see red.” He also mentions stress from balancing finances and family responsibilities, which may contribute to his irritability. Though he initially frames the problem as “people piss me off” or stress, he does admit, “I know I overreact. I don’t want to be this angry.” He has occasionally drunk alcohol to unwind and admits that when he’s been drinking, he’s more likely to lose his temper. No severe substance dependence is reported, but there is periodic binge drinking. He has minor health issues (high blood pressure) likely exacerbated by constant stress and anger. At first, Carlos seems defensive in therapy, stating “I’m not crazy, I don’t need a shrink. I’m just here so my wife doesn’t leave me.”

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Beneath Carlos’s aggressive exterior lies a deep well of vulnerability and emotional pain that he seldom acknowledges. The core of this pain is anchored in two primary maladaptive emotions: shame and fear. Carlos grew up being taught that a “real man” must never show fear or weakness. However, as a child he often felt terrified – of his father’s temper and of the violence in his neighborhood. Admitting that terror was not an option in his environment, so it became buried. Additionally, early experiences of being harshly scolded or hit by his father instilled a sense of humiliation and powerlessness in Carlos as a boy. For example, he recalls a memory of his father whipping him with a belt at age 8 for talking back – he felt shame, like “I’m just a pathetic crybaby,” in that moment. These experiences created an internal schema of inadequacy and danger: “The world is a place where you’re either strong or you get hurt. If I’m not on top, I’ll be crushed.” The emotional pain at the center of this is a blend of worthlessness (shame at not being able to stop being hurt) and fear (of being harmed or dominated) ￼. Essentially, there’s a wounded inner child in Carlos who feels small, scared, and not good enough. That child’s pain is covered by the adult’s rage.

Maladaptive Emotion Scheme: Carlos’s maladaptive emotion scheme can be summarized as “attack or be attacked.” This scheme developed from growing up in a setting where vulnerability was punished. It includes the core belief that “If I don’t assert dominance, I will be humiliated or hurt.” The primary maladaptive emotions fueling it are aforementioned shame and fear, but these are quickly transformed (or rather, obscured) by anger as a defensive strategy. When Carlos perceives someone challenging or disrespecting him (triggering his latent fear of being dominated or his shame of feeling inferior), his emotional system reflexively activates secondary reactive anger ￼. This anger floods in to protect him from feeling the intolerable threat underneath. Over years, this pattern became almost automatic: slight provocation → a flash of core hurt (e.g., feeling disrespected, which touches his shame of “I’m not valued”) → immediate anger response to shut down that hurt. His anger scheme also involves physiological hyperarousal – his heart pounds, muscles tense – as if preparing for a fight for survival. It’s worth noting that part of his emotional schema is learned from male role models (father, uncles, peers) who equated anger with strength. So, anger has become not only a defense but part of his identity of being “strong.” Unfortunately, this scheme is maladaptive in most contexts because it’s based on an outdated map of the world: Carlos often perceives hostility or threat where there is little or none, due to this inner filter. The cost is high – it alienates loved ones and keeps him from ever addressing the underlying wounds of fear and worthlessness.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: On the surface, Carlos has an underregulated emotional style in the domain of anger – he expresses anger readily, intensely, and sometimes explosively. He has a quick trigger and a high level of emotional arousal during conflicts. In therapy, when recounting incidents where he felt provoked, he visibly becomes agitated: voice raises, posture tenses, as if re-living the confrontation. This shows how easily his sympathetic nervous system fires up in perceived conflict. However, in the realm of vulnerable emotions (sadness, fear, hurt), Carlos is extremely overregulated or avoidant. He almost never cries and insists that things “don’t bother” him, despite evidence to the contrary. When conversation in therapy steers toward feeling hurt or scared, he deflects with statements like “I don’t get scared, I get angry.” This indicates a rigid emotional inhibition regarding any affect he deems weak. Thus, his emotional style is polarized: over-expressive with anger, hyper-inhibited with vulnerability. Additionally, Carlos tends to be externally focused – very quick to notice others’ transgressions or threats, but not very reflective about his inner feelings. This outward focus keeps him from identifying his emotional states until they boil over.

Defensive Coping Mechanisms: Carlos’s chief defense mechanism is anger itself as a defense – a classic case of secondary emotion overshadowing primary feelings. He has essentially learned to convert fear or hurt into anger instantaneously. For example, if his wife says, “I’m upset you forgot our anniversary,” instead of hearing that as her feeling hurt (and perhaps feeling guilt or fear of losing her love), he immediately reacts with anger: “Why are you always on my case?!” This aggressive stance defends against the vulnerability of acknowledging he disappointed her and the anxiety that she might stop loving him. Another defense is hyper-masculine posturing – he projects toughness and invulnerability at nearly all times. This bravado is a way to ward off anyone seeing his soft spots; it’s as if he’s saying, “Don’t even think of messing with me, I’m not weak.” In therapy, this appeared as initial resistance like “Talking about feelings is for wimps.” That dismissiveness was a defense against having to actually delve into feelings.

Carlos also uses projection: he often accuses others of disrespect or hostility that they may not intend, essentially projecting his own inner aggression/fear outward. By seeing others as the aggressors (“He was looking at me like I’m stupid, so I had to set him straight”), he justifies his anger and avoids confronting the fact that the intensity of his reaction is coming from within himself. Rationalization is present too – he frequently justifies his outbursts as reasonable responses to others’ behavior (“Anybody would’ve blown up if they were in my shoes”). This prevents him from feeling guilt or examining the disproportion of his reactions. Additionally, substance use (alcohol) lowers his inhibitions, which isn’t exactly a deliberate defense but serves to further numb any subtle anxiety and make aggressive action more likely – in a way, it’s a coping strategy to feel temporarily confident and untroubled, though it backfires. Finally, behind the anger, Carlos often experiences emotional numbing after an explosion – a kind of shut-down or empty feeling once the adrenaline crashes. This could be a form of dissociative defense; after the storm, he goes blank rather than sitting with remorse or sorrow. In summary, Carlos’s psyche defends his wounded inner self through a fortress of aggression, pride, and blame, ensuring that the tender feelings of fear, shame, and hurt rarely see the light of day.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: By the midpoint of therapy, Carlos (somewhat to his own surprise) has gained insight into the emotional drivers of his anger. The formulation we’ve developed is that Carlos’s rage reactions are like a fire that flares up to cover an earlier, more vulnerable wound. Specifically, when he feels even slightly disrespected, criticized, or out of control, it pricks at a core wound of powerless helplessness from his childhood. That wound is so painful and scary for him that, almost reflexively, anger surges as a protective mechanism. We have identified that under his anger often lies a split-second of hurt or fear – e.g., fear of being seen as weak, or hurt at feeling not valued – which he typically doesn’t even notice because the anger overtakes him so fast. Part of our formulation references how secondary emotions like anger can obscure primary emotions ￼. In Carlos’s case, the anger obscures a deep-seated fear of being vulnerable and a shame about not being “good enough” or in control.

For instance, we revisited the wall-punching incident. Initially, Carlos insisted it was because his wife was “nagging.” But as we dissected it, he eventually admitted that her comments about him forgetting a chore made him feel “like I can’t do anything right” – which is a shame reaction. He also acknowledged a flash of fear: “I worried she’d think I’m a lousy husband.” Those feelings of inadequacy and fear of rejection quickly morphed into rage because, as a kid, feeling “not good enough” in his father’s eyes was met with ridicule or more abuse. Thus, our formulation traces how triggers in the present (someone’s criticism or challenge) activate the past: the boy who felt humiliated by Dad, or threatened by bullies, comes on stage internally. And that boy’s solution was to vow never to be weak again. Now the adult “solution” is anger and intimidation – he becomes the powerful one to avoid ever being the powerless one.

We have formulated that Carlos’s anger is both a sword and a shield: a sword to strike preemptively at any perceived threat, and a shield to protect the frightened child inside. Unfortunately, this strategy is outdated; in reality, not every raised voice or differing opinion is a true threat, and his intense responses create new problems (like estranging his wife, trouble at work). The formulation also includes the role of cultural and familial conditioning – we acknowledged that in his family and environment, anger was modeled as the only acceptable emotion for a man. Understanding this has helped Carlos feel less “defective” – he can see he was following a script given to him, one that now as an adult he can choose to rewrite.

Importantly, we identified a feedback loop maintaining his difficulties: his aggressive behaviors lead to guilt and moments of self-loathing (more shame), or actual consequences like his wife pulling away (feeding his fear of abandonment). But instead of processing those feelings adaptively, he doubles down on anger to avoid them, which then leads to more incidents. Recognizing this loop, Carlos actually said in one session, “So I’m basically stuck in a cycle of my own bull***t, huh?” – a crude but apt summary.

Through marker-based work in therapy, we’ve had moments where the tender emotion surfaced: in one powerful session, an empty-chair exercise with an imagined father figure allowed Carlos to express long-suppressed sadness and longing for acceptance. He broke into tears saying, “Why wasn’t I ever good enough, Dad?” This was a breakthrough showing the core pain of feeling unlovable and craving approval that underlies much of his anger. After that session, our formulation solidified around the idea that at his core, Carlos carries a young part of him that feels very small, frightened, and yearning for respect/love. His adult anger has been both an attempt to demand that respect and to protect that young part from further pain.

Summing up the case formulation: Carlos’s history of abuse and harshness taught him to survive by being tough and never vulnerable. This created a schema where anger = strength, and vulnerability = danger. Now, when he faces normal interpersonal friction, this schema misfires, interpreting it as high threat and releasing anger to cope. The true issues are the unhealed fear and shame from childhood fueling this hair-trigger response. This understanding has resonated with Carlos; while it’s still hard for him to consistently apply, he has begun to catch glimpses of “feeling like that scared kid” in some situations, which is a big step toward change.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Initial Obstacles: At the outset, Carlos’s core issues were well-concealed behind bravado and blame. He entered therapy reluctantly, mainly to appease his wife, and his initial stance was defensive. In those early sessions, he was quick to justify every instance of anger as someone else’s fault. This external focus completely hid the internal vulnerabilities; he was narrating a world where other people caused his anger, leaving no space to consider his own pain or fear. If the therapist tentatively suggested “It sounds like you felt disrespected (or hurt) in that moment,” Carlos would shoot it down: “I wasn’t hurt, I was pissed off – big difference.” His insistence on equating feelings with anger alone acted as a protective smokescreen. Essentially, his self-concept as a “tough guy” in the beginning left no room for “weak” feelings, making the therapy feel somewhat stuck on the surface level of incidents rather than feelings.

Defensive Distrust: Moreover, Carlos initially had a distrust of the therapy process. He feared (perhaps unconsciously) that probing into feelings would make him feel exposed or judged. Therefore, he was often guarded, occasionally even challenging the therapist – e.g., “Have you ever grown up in a neighborhood like mine? No? Then you don’t get it.” This was a defensive maneuver to keep the focus away from his own emotional wounds and put the therapist on the defensive instead. It took a bit of alignment and acknowledgement of his life experience to lower this guard.

His tendency to normalize his behavior also hid the core issues. He’d say things like, “Every couple fights, I’m not any different” or “That’s just how men in my family are.” By normalizing it, he deflected away from examining why he specifically reacts so intensely. It was a way of saying “there’s no deeper reason, it’s just normal,” which is a form of denial. This prevented immediate exploration of triggers or past events. Additionally, his use of humor and sarcasm in early sessions served to keep things light – for instance, when asked about his childhood, he smirked and said, “Well, I wasn’t exactly cuddled and sung lullabies, let’s put it that way,” then quickly moved on. The joke belied a painful reality, but by not staying with it, he avoided feeling that pain.

Another key way the core was hidden: the speed of his anger reaction. In real time, even in session when recounting something, he’d get worked up fast – this mirrors how in life the anger comes so quickly that the vulnerable feeling is almost instantly covered. It was like trying to catch a brief flash of lightning; in session, the therapist had to slow him way down to even identify “what happened inside right before you started yelling?” Initially, Carlos genuinely couldn’t answer that – he wasn’t aware of any “before,” he just saw red. This illustrates how his defenses (the anger surge) were immediate, leaving the underlying trigger feeling unnoticed.

As therapy progressed, small cracks appeared. For example, at first he flat-out denied fearing anything. But one day, when discussing his toddler son, he admitted, “Sometimes I worry I’ll screw him up like my pops did to me.” He quickly tried to retract it with a laugh, but that moment was telling – it revealed fear and concern, and also a recognition of the cycle. That fear for his son’s well-being (and perhaps fear of becoming his father) was a softer emotion. It was fleeting, but by gently catching it and not shaming it, the therapist helped Carlos stay with it a second longer. Such moments were key to penetrating the defensive shell. Initially, though, those softer feelings were heavily guarded.

In summary, the core understanding – that Carlos’s rage is fueled by buried fear and shame – was initially obscured by his entrenched habits of blaming others, denying weakness, and distrusting the therapeutic exploration. His persona of the “unapologetically angry man” acted as armor, preventing anyone (including himself) from seeing the hurt child inside. It was only after building trust and pointing out inconsistencies (like how a minor issue caused an outsized reaction) that he began to consider that maybe there was something deeper going on. Over time, as Carlos felt respected and not judged in therapy, he gradually allowed discussions of childhood memories and insecurities, which finally shone light on the hidden core issues that had been there all along.

# Case6 – “Nina” (Moderate Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 40 years old
	•	Gender: Female (she/her)
	•	Background: High school teacher. Recently remarried; two teenage sons from her first marriage (they primarily live with their father). Nina comes from a family where she was the oldest of five siblings; her mother struggled with chronic illness, so Nina took on caregiving roles from a young age. She identifies with a Christian upbringing that emphasized self-sacrifice. She has a history of anxiety and stress-related ailments (migraines, ulcers). No prior therapy, but she’s read self-help books extensively.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Unmet needs + self‑criticism → guilt → hopelessness/somatic symptoms. Childhood contingencies taught caretaking = love; current depression reflects abandoned self. Naming needs and tolerating assertiveness modestly lifts mood; grief for never receiving care surfaces.
- **Emotional Style:** Warm/agreeable surface with suppressed anger/need; alexithymic tendencies; overregulated negative affect.
- **Defenses (common):** Warm/agreeable surface with suppressed anger/need; alexithymic tendencies; overregulated negative affect. Deflection, rationalization/minimization, suppression, reaction formation, guilt-as-governor; identity as “helper” defends against rejection fears.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Nina presents to therapy utterly exhausted and depressed. She describes feeling overwhelmed by life’s demands and emotionally numb. “I have nothing left to give, but everyone still needs me,” she says tearfully. Her presenting issues include: frequent crying spells, feelings of worthlessness, and resentment that quickly turns into guilt. She reports tension with her new husband because she chronically people-pleases and then secretly resents not getting help or appreciation. For example, she manages all household chores and her husband’s paperwork, but then feels angry he doesn’t notice her effort. Nina also mentions psychosomatic symptoms – severe migraines and stomach pain flair up whenever she’s under pressure or holding in emotions. A recent incident that precipitated therapy was fainting in the grocery store, which doctors attributed to stress. Additionally, her ex-husband has been critical of her parenting, and rather than standing up to him, she’s internalized his words, sinking deeper into self-blame. Nina initially frames her problem as burnout and confusion: “I don’t understand why I’m so down. I have a good life compared to many. I just need to figure out how to cope better.” She’s hesitant and feels selfish coming to therapy, saying “Maybe I just need to toughen up.”

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Underneath Nina’s weariness lies a core emotional pain of unfulfilled needs and fear of abandonment. She has spent her life taking care of others to earn love, at great cost to herself. The central painful emotions for Nina are fear and shame: a fear of abandonment/rejection (that if she doesn’t constantly please and caretake, she will be left unloved) and a shame-based sense of unworthiness (believing she’s never doing or being “good enough” unless she’s perfect in her roles) ￼. This originates from her childhood – as the eldest daughter in a chaotic family, she learned that her worth came from being “the responsible one” and that expressing her own needs led to disappointment or criticism. She vividly recalls as a child getting upset and crying once saying “I can’t do it all,” and her overwhelmed father scolded her for being selfish. Experiences like that cemented her maladaptive belief: “My needs don’t matter; I’m loved only when I give, not when I ask.” This is profoundly painful because it leaves her with an inner loneliness – a sense that no one truly cares for her the way she cares for them. She also carries an internalized shame whenever she feels anger or need, thinking it means she’s a bad person (a selfish or “not good” woman). So at the core, Nina’s pain is the sadness of feeling unloved/unsupported and the anxious fear of being unwanted if she ever stops giving ￼.

Maladaptive Emotion Scheme: Nina’s life is organized by a self-sacrificing (or “superwoman”) schema ￼. The scheme can be summarized as: “I must take care of everyone and not burden others; if I falter, I’ll be rejected and it will prove I’m unworthy.” The primary maladaptive emotions driving this are shame (when she thinks she’s not doing enough or not succeeding in helping others, she feels deeply inadequate) and anxiety/fear (specifically attachment anxiety – the fear that loved ones will leave or stop valuing her if she isn’t constantly useful and agreeable) ￼. This schema was adaptive in her youth – taking care of siblings earned her praise, and neglecting herself was the only way to keep the family functioning. But now it’s maladaptive: it compels her to ignore her own limits and feelings, leading to burnout and depression.

Key components of the schema include interruptive processes: whenever Nina has a self-focused need or negative feeling, an automatic process kicks in to shut that down ￼. For example, if she feels angry that her husband came home late without calling, immediately her mind generates guilt and rationalizations (“He must have had a hard day; I shouldn’t be angry, that’s not nice”). She then might bake his favorite dessert to compensate for even thinking angrily. Thus her true emotions get suppressed by layers of guilt and rationalization ￼. Another aspect is her unmet needs for appreciation and support ￼, which remain unvoiced. Over time, these unaddressed needs have morphed into a quiet despair inside her – the depression of someone who feels invisible and unworthy of care.

Nina’s maladaptive scheme also contains a narrative that “If something goes wrong, it’s my fault for not doing enough.” So she takes excessive responsibility (e.g., if her son struggles at school, she thinks, “I should have been a better mother,” rather than considering external factors). This self-blame is part of her shame. It spurs her to try even harder to fix things – a vicious cycle since life’s problems are endless. In sum, Nina’s underlying schema is a perfectionistic caretaker identity, fueled by fear of abandonment and shame, which has led her to abandon herself.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: Nina’s emotional style is outwardly warm, accommodating, and restrained regarding any negative emotion. She is highly attuned to others’ feelings but often disconnected from her own. In sessions, she smiles and speaks in gentle tones even when describing very stressful situations, which suggests she habitually downplays her distress. She rarely expresses anger or frustration openly; instead, those feelings leak out through a tired, flat affect or moments of tearfulness that she quickly stifles. Internally, Nina experiences a lot of anxiety and self-criticism – her mind is constantly worrying “Am I doing enough? Did I upset them? How can I fix this?”. However, she has difficulty labeling her own emotions beyond “stressed” or “sad sometimes.” This hints at a degree of alexithymia (difficulty identifying feelings) stemming from chronic focus on others and suppression of self-focused emotions. When it comes to emotional regulation, Nina is generally overregulated: she tightly controls and suppresses what she perceives as “bad” emotions like anger ￼. The only emotion that breaks through her control at times is overwhelm, which emerges as crying spells or panic – essentially when her capacity to contain everything is exceeded. But even then, she tends to cry alone in private, not in front of those who might actually comfort her. Overall, her style is one of composure and care on the surface, with an undercurrent of neglected sorrow.

Defensive Coping Mechanisms: Nina employs several interlocking defenses: deflection, rationalization, suppression, and reaction formation, among others. A primary defense is deflection – whenever conversation or thought moves toward her own needs or someone trying to care for her, she swiftly redirects to another topic or back to caring for them. For instance, if a friend asks how she’s doing, she’ll quickly say “Oh I’m fine, but how are you? How’s your mother’s health?” She deflects attention away from herself, which keeps her from being vulnerable or expecting care (thus avoiding potential disappointment).

She heavily uses rationalization and minimization regarding her feelings ￼. If she feels hurt that her husband forgot their anniversary, she immediately rationalizes: “He’s busy; it’s understandable he forgot. It’s not a big deal, I’m overreacting.” This intellectualization of emotional slights serves to invalidate her own feelings and prevent conflict. Suppression is evident in how she deals with anger and sadness – she “pushes it down.” She mentioned that when upset, she often takes a deep breath, forces a smile, and carries on as if nothing happened (though later she might have a migraine or cry alone).

Another defense is a form of reaction formation: she responds to any hint of selfish feeling by doing something even more selfless. For example, after feeling a flash of annoyance at her son for being ungrateful, she immediately baked his favorite cookies – essentially acting the opposite of her fleeting angry impulse, as if to atone for it. This is driven by her internal rule that she must always be giving and forgiving. Guilt is both an emotion and a mechanism for her; it floods her whenever she asserts herself, thereby pushing her back into a submissive stance.

Additionally, Nina’s identity as the “helper” is itself a defense – by being needed constantly, she avoids facing her fear of being not wanted. It’s safer to always be busy taking care of others than to risk asking for care and possibly being rejected. Lastly, her psychosomatic symptoms can be seen as her body’s way of expressing what her mind won’t – when she cannot speak her pain or anger, her body “speaks” through headaches and illness. These symptoms ironically provide a socially acceptable reason to rest (only physical sickness, not emotional need, justifies stepping back in her mind). In summary, Nina’s defenses work in concert to ensure she rarely asks “What about me?” – she wards off that dangerous question with busyness, guilt, and reframing everything to be about what others need.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: By the middle phase of therapy, Nina and the therapist have developed a poignant understanding of how her lifetime pattern of self-negation is connected to her current depression and health issues. The case formulation is that Nina’s depression and “burnout” are rooted in a core schema of needing to earn love through self-sacrifice, fueled by fear of abandonment and shame about her own needs ￼. This schema originated in her family of origin and has replayed in her adult relationships, keeping her stuck in unbalanced, unfulfilling roles.

We identified that Nina’s presenting sadness and resentment are actually secondary emotions – they arise because her primary adaptive emotions (like healthy anger or longing for care) have been chronically bypassed or squelched ￼. For example, when her contributions go unacknowledged, the adaptive response might be some anger (“I deserve appreciation”) or assertiveness about her needs. But Nina immediately transforms that into guilt for feeling that way, and depression ensues as the energy of anger turns inward. Our formulation highlights this process: unmet needs and unspoken feelings → internal self-criticism and guilt (interruptive processes) → hopelessness and psychosomatic symptoms. Over time, this cycle has worn her down, resulting in the state of learned helplessness and emptiness she described.

A key insight in the formulation is recognizing Nina’s core maladaptive beliefs: “If I assert myself or fail to help, I will be abandoned” and “I am only worthwhile when giving.” We traced these beliefs to specific childhood memories, such as a poignant one where 10-year-old Nina was nursing her sick mother and her father praised her saying, “You’re such a good girl, we’d be lost without you.” That was likely one of the few times she got positive attention, reinforcing that caretaking = love. Conversely, when she later needed comfort after being bullied at school, her parents were too preoccupied, subtly teaching her that her hurts were not important. By mid-therapy, Nina could see how those experiences formed her life script.

The formulation also acknowledges how this schema played out in her first marriage: she overfunctioned (did everything for her husband and kids), while her ex-husband underfunctioned and even criticized her – a dynamic that eventually led to resentment and collapse of the marriage. Instead of recognizing her ex’s role in the marital issues, Nina initially blamed herself entirely, reinforcing her shame. In therapy, we reframed it: her inability to set boundaries or express needs contributed, but that was rooted in her schema, and her ex took advantage of it. This reframing reduced some self-blame and helped her see the broader pattern. Now, in her second marriage, the same pattern was emerging – and this time she desperately wants to change it so as not to repeat history.

We’ve crystallized the core theme of Nina’s life as “taking care of others at the expense of herself to ensure she is loved”. This theme was hidden from her conscious awareness for years because it just felt like “the right thing to do” or her duty, especially under cultural/religious ideals she held. But therapy helped her label it and question it. We also identified her unmet needs clearly: she longs for appreciation, for someone to take care of her for a change, and to feel it’s okay to rest. Admitting those needs was emotionally charged – she broke down crying, saying she feels “selfish” for even wanting those things. That emotional moment was crucial, as it illuminated how harshly she forbids herself basic care, and how much grief there is over never having felt allowed to receive.

In mid-phase, we observe that Nina’s depression is starting to lift slightly as she makes small changes (like delegating a task or expressing a minor preference). This is evidence that addressing the schema yields immediate emotional relief. The formulation guides these changes by reminding her (and the therapist) that whenever she tries to prioritize herself, her fear and guilt spike due to the old belief of imminent abandonment or unworthiness ￼. Knowing this, we approach those moments gently, using techniques like chair dialogues with her inner critic (the voice that says “you’re selfish”) to transform it. Already, a narrative is forming where Nina can say, “I learned to be Superwoman to be loved, but it’s okay now to be human and have needs.”

In summary, the case formulation mid-therapy is: Nina’s chronic giving and lack of self-care are driven by a core fear of abandonment and shame of not being enough ￼. These have led her to suppress her true feelings (anger, need for love) ￼, resulting in depression, resentment, and physical symptoms. The path forward is to help her experience and validate her core emotions and needs, challenge the belief that she must be a superwoman for others to love her, and learn that asserting herself will not result in the catastrophe she fears. This understanding is comprehensive and resonant for Nina – for the first time, she’s starting to see her exhaustion not as personal failure but as an understandable outcome of an unsustainable life pattern.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Initial Presentation vs. Core: Initially, Nina’s core issues were masked by her own confusion and framing of the problem as purely situational. She came in saying “I’m just so busy and stressed,” attributing her distress to external circumstances (busy life, new marriage adjustments, etc.) and personal weakness (“I should handle this better”). She did not mention deeper feelings like fear of being unloved, nor did she connect her current situation to her childhood. In fact, early on when asked about her upbringing, she painted it in a positive light (“It taught me responsibility”). Her narrative lacked any acknowledgment of the emotional neglect she experienced. This positive-spinning was a form of denial/minimization, hiding the core problem that she never learned to receive care.

Defenses in Session: In initial sessions, whenever the therapist gently touched on the idea of her needs or feelings, Nina would almost immediately shift focus. For example, if asked “How do you feel toward your husband when he doesn’t help out?” she answered, “I know he works hard and I don’t mind doing things, I just wish I had more energy.” She avoided saying “I feel angry” or “I feel unsupported,” likely because admitting those could evoke guilt or conflict, which she was trained to avoid. This avoidant redirection kept the therapy at surface level for a short while, focusing on problem-solving (like time management) rather than the emotional drivers.

Her people-pleasing even extended into the therapy room. She often responded to the therapist’s questions with what she thought was the “right” answer or one that wouldn’t make the therapist worry. If she got emotional and the therapist inquired, “What’s happening for you right now?”, Nina might quickly compose herself and say “Oh, I’m fine, sorry about that.” She was guarding against being a burden or appearing too needy – effectively enacting the very pattern in therapy that we needed to address. This made it challenging to access her raw emotions; they would appear in a tear or quivering lip, but she’d swiftly apologize and tuck them away.

Schema Hiding Itself: One tricky aspect was that Nina’s very schema of selflessness made it hard for her to even see the problem. She genuinely believed her only issue was not being efficient or strong enough. The idea that the way she was living – always giving, never asking – was part of the pathology was foreign to her. Thus, the maladaptive schema hid in plain sight, disguised as virtue. It was reinforced by culture and religion (she’d quote “It is more blessed to give than to receive”), so questioning it felt like questioning her core values. Initially, if the therapist hinted that maybe she is too hard on herself or deserves care, she deflected with statements like “Oh, I’m fine, others have it worse.” This shows how her comparative thinking (others have it worse) minimized her own suffering, keeping the focus off her core unmet needs.

She also had some cognitive blocks: for instance, early on she insisted she did communicate her needs, saying “I do ask for help – I told my husband I was tired.” But with exploration, it emerged she said it in a joking, dismissive way and followed with “but it’s okay, I can handle it” – undermining her own request. This lack of clarity was a defense (albeit unwitting) because if she never straightforwardly asks, she can maintain the belief that others won’t help (justifying her worldview) and avoid the risk of a direct refusal.

Finally, her shame about even being in therapy obscured things. She expressed worry that “I’m being selfish talking about myself so much.” This meta-level guilt about attending to herself sometimes led her to spend parts of sessions talking about other people’s problems (like her sister’s marital issues) instead of her own. It was as if she needed to “pay” for the spotlight on her by offering help to someone else, even hypothetically. This was a subtle but telling defensive maneuver – even in her own therapy, she tried to caretake.

Through consistent empathy and gently refocusing on her, the therapist gradually helped Nina lower these defenses. Trust and safety in the therapeutic relationship were key; when she realized she wasn’t being judged as selfish by the therapist (in fact, the therapist validated that her needs mattered), she slowly allowed more of her authentic feelings to come through. The first time she allowed herself to get openly angry in session (venting about her ex-husband’s treatment of her) was a breakthrough – she stopped mid-sentence, shocked, and said “I’ve never said things like that out loud.” That moment illuminated how forbidden such expressions had been for her. It was the beginning of dismantling the wall that had hidden her core truth: that inside the ever-capable giver was a very tired, hurt person longing to be cared for, whose entire way of being had been constructed to hide that truth for decades.

# Case7 – “Aisha” (Hard Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 26 years old
	•	Gender: Female (she/her)
	•	Background: Unemployed currently; has a history of unstable employment. Aisha grew up in foster care from age 5 to 12 after being removed from her biological mother due to neglect and abuse. She was later adopted at 13, but that placement had significant conflict. She has a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder and a history of self-harm (cutting) and multiple suicide attempts (most recent was 6 months ago). She is single, with a pattern of intense, short-lived relationships. No children. She has been in therapy before and hospitalized twice for psychiatric stabilization.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Perceived distancing → panic/sadness/shame → frantic reassurance/testing or rage → partner withdraws → abandonment confirmed. Behaviors are desperate attempts to avert annihilating aloneness. Therapy maps push‑pull cycles; titrated access to core grief/longing increases reflective capacity.
- **Emotional Style:** Underregulated, labile affect; dissociation under stress.
- **Defenses (common):** Underregulated, labile affect; dissociation under stress. Splitting, projection/projective identification, acting out (self‑harm/suicidality), devaluation/idealization, pre‑emptive rejection of attachment figures.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Aisha comes to therapy in a state of emotional turmoil and crisis. She sought help after her last boyfriend broke up with her, which triggered what she describes as “unbearable abandonment feelings” and a suicide attempt. Presenting issues include: extreme mood swings (she goes from feeling deep adoration for someone to rage and panic at perceived slights), chronic feelings of emptiness (“I don’t know who I am or what’s the point of living”), and self-harming behaviors (cutting her forearms to “feel something or to calm down”). She also reports episodes of dissociation under stress, saying she sometimes feels unreal or watches herself from outside her body during intense emotions. In sessions, her emotions are labile – one moment tearful and pleading not to be left, the next moment irritable or storming out if she feels misunderstood. She expresses profound fears: “Everyone leaves me. I can’t handle it. I’ll die if I’m alone.” Aisha’s initial framing of the problem is that she is in intense pain because people always abandon or betray her, and she desperately wants to learn how to not scare them away or how to cope if they do. She often says she is “too broken” or “messed up” to ever be happy. Trust with any therapist is hard for her; in the first sessions, she oscillates between clinging (“You’re the only one who might help me”) and skepticism/anger (“You’re just going to give up on me like everyone else”).

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: At the heart of Aisha’s difficulties is excruciating emotional pain rooted in early trauma and attachment injury. The central components of this pain are terror of abandonment and a core shame of feeling fundamentally unlovable or “bad” ￼ ￼. As a young child, Aisha experienced severe neglect (being left alone without food) and abuse (her mother’s boyfriends physically and sexually abused her). These formative experiences taught her that the world, especially caregivers, are dangerous and unpredictable. She internalized a belief: “I am abandoned because I am unworthy of love; there’s something bad about me that makes people hurt or leave me.” This is an intensely painful schema. The primary maladaptive emotions associated are deep fear (trauma-based fear of being harmed and fear of abandonment) and shame (believing she’s dirty, ruined, or unworthy) ￼. Aisha often describes a feeling of a “black hole” inside her chest – that void is the lonely, bereft child within who never consistently felt safe or wanted. Along with fear and shame, she carries profound sadness and rage: sadness from the multiple abandonments (bio mother, foster situations, even adoptive parents to a degree) and rage at the injustices she suffered (though this rage is often turned against herself or anyone close by). Her emotional pain is so raw that she sometimes says it manifests as physical pain or as if she’s “on fire” with agony when she fears someone is leaving.

Maladaptive Emotion Scheme(s): Aisha’s core schemas revolve around abandonment and mistrust. One dominant maladaptive scheme is: “Those I love will abandon me – I will be left utterly alone and it will be because I’m not good enough to love.” Another closely tied is: “If someone gets close, they will eventually hurt or reject me.” These schemas produce extreme emotional reactions. For example, when she perceives a slight distancing from a loved one, it triggers that abandonment schema full force, launching her into panic and despair. The maladaptive emotions at play are a primal fear of abandonment (anxious terror, as if her survival is at stake) and toxic shame (a belief she’s so flawed that everyone will leave) ￼. In response to these, a cascade of secondary reactions often comes: intense anger (if she feels betrayed) or numbness/dissociation (when the pain is too much).

Another facet is an identity disturbance: having been treated as “bad” or unwanted, she doesn’t have a stable sense of self-worth. So she clings externally for validation and identity, which is part of the abandonment schema – “I am nobody unless someone loves me, and if they go, I am nothing.” This desperation makes any threat of separation feel annihilating.

Her emotion schemes also include splitting (a defense but also part of how she experiences emotions): people are either all good or all bad depending on how safe or abandoning they seem in the moment. This means her feelings flip dramatically; one moment a person is her savior (so she feels hope, relief, adoration), the next, if they disappoint, that person becomes cruel in her mind and she feels hatred and terror. This black-and-white emotional experience is maladaptive but arose from early life where caregivers indeed oscillated between harmful and absent; she had to categorize quickly for survival.

Additionally, Aisha has a maladaptive shame-based self-schema: deep down she feels contaminated by her early sexual abuse – like she is filthy or ruined. She seldom articulates this directly, but it surfaces in statements like “I feel disgusting” or why she sometimes self-harms (to punish herself for being “bad” or to express self-loathing). Thus, her underlying pain is a complex knot of fear (of being hurt/left), shame (of being worthless and dirty), and yearning – a desperate unmet need to be loved and secure that has never been adequately fulfilled. All her volatile behaviors can be understood as attempts (maladaptive ones) to cope with or reverse these intolerable feelings.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: Aisha’s emotional style is highly underregulated – she feels things with overwhelming intensity and struggles to soothe herself or moderate her reactions. Her affect can be like a rollercoaster: euphoric or intensely attached when feeling secure, but plummeting into despair or explosive anger at the slightest cue of rejection. She has very little emotional skin; even small triggers set off big responses. This volatility is characteristic of severe attachment trauma – her nervous system is on a hair-trigger. In sessions, if the therapist is even a few minutes late or phrases something imperfectly, Aisha’s face might suddenly contort with hurt or fury, showing how swiftly and deeply she feels perceived slights. Conversely, a small kindness can flood her with gratitude and dependency. She oscillates between extremes: desperate clinging (“please don’t leave me, I need you”) and fierce pushing away (“I hate you, you’re going to hurt me”).

She also experiences episodes of dissociation – when emotions hit a certain threshold, she might go numb or feel like she’s floating outside herself. This is a leftover adaptive response from childhood trauma: when she was being hurt or felt terrified, her mind likely detached to survive. In the present, during times of intense abandonment panic or shame, her psyche sometimes employs the same strategy, leaving her feeling empty or unreal. This adds to her self-report of emptiness.

Defensive Mechanisms: Aisha’s defenses are paradoxical: some are primitive and frantic attempts to get her needs met (which can alienate others), and others are self-protective moves that unfortunately also block intimacy. Key defenses include splitting, projection, projective identification, acting out, and dissociation.
	•	Splitting: As mentioned, she sees others (and even herself) in black-or-white terms. This defense protects her from the complexity and ambiguity that someone could love her yet still hurt or leave her. It’s safer in her mind to flip between “all good” and “all bad” rather than hold the painful complexity that someone she loves might unintentionally hurt her but still care. Splitting results in unstable relationships, as someone can go from hero to villain in her eyes in an instant.
	•	Projection: She often projects her own feared feelings onto others. For example, if she feels a glimmer of wanting to pull away (maybe due to shame), she might accuse them of abandoning her. Or if she’s angry at someone, she might insist they are furious with her. This projection externalizes the chaos inside her, but it also creates self-fulfilling prophecies (people feel falsely accused and actually pull back).
	•	Projective Identification: This is a bit advanced conceptually, but often seen in BPD – Aisha might unconsciously induce in others the feelings she herself cannot handle. For instance, through her frantic demands or accusations, she can stir frustration or a wish to escape in the very person she fears will leave, thus concretizing her worst fears. In this way, she “identifies” others with her projection and then reacts to them as if her fear is proven true. This dynamic is a defense in the sense that it allows her internal world to be acted out externally, albeit at great interpersonal cost.
	•	Acting Out: Aisha’s self-harm episodes and suicidal gestures are, in one sense, coping attempts, but also defenses against unbearable affect. When her emotional pain hits a threshold, cutting provides a physical release/distraction – a way to avoid the full psychological impact by converting it to physical pain (which she finds more tolerable or controllable). Similarly, suicide attempts, though earnest in her despair, sometimes serve to communicate the depth of her need when she feels words are insufficient or she fears being ignored. In other words, these behaviors act out feelings that she cannot soothe or fully articulate, effectively “showing” others (and herself) how much pain she’s in, without having to put it into words or vulnerability which she fears might be dismissed.
	•	Dissociation: As touched on, when emotional arousal is too high (like intense shame or panic), she may check out mentally. This is a defense because it shelters her from feeling the pain in that moment, but leaves her feeling numb or unreal, which can be distressing in its own right. Sometimes she self-harms specifically to stop dissociating – the pain brings her back to feeling real. This demonstrates how her coping can ping-pong: one defense (dissociation) makes her feel empty, so she uses another (cutting) to counteract that. It’s a chaotic internal toolbox.
	•	Devaluation as Defense: Specifically with attachment figures (therapist included), if she starts feeling too attached (which scares her because attachment has always led to pain), she might suddenly devalue them – deciding they’re terrible, rejecting them before they can reject her. This is a pre-emptive defense: “I’ll leave (or emotionally distance) you before you inevitably hurt or leave me.” However, the moment the person does pull back, her feelings flip again to desperate need.

In essence, Aisha’s defenses are intense and often self-sabotaging, but they all circle around one goal: to survive an anticipated abandonment or betrayal with as little devastation as possible. Sadly, the defenses often create the scenario she dreads, reinforcing her core beliefs.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: By the midpoint of therapy, despite the challenges in the alliance, we have pieced together a coherent (though emotionally charged) narrative of Aisha’s struggles. The case formulation centers on the recognition that Aisha’s volatile emotions and behaviors are rooted in profound early attachment trauma, leading to core schemas of abandonment, mistrust, and self-loathing ￼. We conceptualize her symptoms as desperate strategies of a wounded child to cope with or prevent the intolerable feelings of being unloved and unsafe.

Together, we’ve identified that when Aisha senses any trigger of abandonment – e.g., a friend not texting back immediately, a slight change in a loved one’s tone – it ignites a “core pain network” in her consisting of panic (fear of aloneness), flooding sadness (sense of loss/rejection), and overarching shame (“It must be my fault; I’m unlovable”) ￼. This overwhelming emotional state (which we might call her “abandoned self” state) is what she has been desperately trying to escape or change through her behaviors. The formulation acknowledges that her angry outbursts or dramatic pleas are, in fact, attempts to either bring the person back closer or to punish them for the hurt – maladaptive ways of saying “Don’t leave me, that kills me inside” or “You hurt me so I need to hurt you (or myself) to show it.” Recognizing this has brought some empathy for herself: she is starting to see these actions not simply as “crazy” but as stemming from a place of extreme pain and a lack of better tools.

We also have addressed how her early experiences inform her present: her biological mother’s inconsistent care and ultimate loss of that relationship created an internal working model that love is fragile and she is somehow responsible (children naturally ego-centrically blame themselves). The abuse taught her that people who say they care can also inflict harm, which causes her profound ambivalence in attachments now – she craves love but is hyper-vigilant and untrusting, scanning for betrayal ￼. The formulation highlights this push-pull dynamic as central: “I hate you, don’t leave me” encapsulates it. We can trace that dynamic to specific childhood moments: e.g., as a little girl, yearning for her mom’s affection yet also hating her mom for neglecting her – those conflicting feelings never got resolved and now play out with others.

Additionally, we’ve pinpointed her core belief: “I am unlovable/bad” ￼. In therapy, this manifested when she assumed the therapist was frustrated with her or didn’t actually care (even when not true). We used an empathic approach to label that assumption as coming from her shame schema rather than reality, which has helped her sometimes pause and check the facts. For instance, after a rupture where she accused the therapist of wishing to get rid of her, upon repair she could reflect, “I guess I always think people secretly hate me like I hate me.” That insight directly names the projected shame. Our formulation thus includes the understanding that fear and shame are master emotions in her experience, driving much of her behavior ￼. We frequently remind ourselves (and her) that when she’s lashing out or sinking into despair, underneath is a terrified part that believes she is about to be abandoned and a ashamed part that believes she deserves it.

Importantly, we have begun mapping the typical cycle: Aisha gets close to someone → she feels anxious (too good, they’ll leave) → she might test them or seek constant reassurance → the person gets overwhelmed or momentarily pulls back → Aisha interprets that as impending abandonment → she has an extreme reaction (self-harm threat, anger) → the person actually distances or ends it → abandonment is fulfilled, reinforcing her belief that “See, I’m unlovable, everyone leaves.” Understanding this cycle in therapy has been emotional for her; she could see how it has played out repeatedly. We approached it non-judgmentally, framing it as a learned survival pattern from childhood that we can work to change. This gave her a glimmer of hope and responsibility: she stated, “Maybe if I can catch it earlier, I don’t have to lose every person….”

The mid-phase work also has touched on addressing her dissociation and emotional overwhelm. We formulated that when feelings become too intense (especially flashbacks of abuse or deep shame), a young part of her “shuts off” to protect her (dissociates). We have recognized this as a survival skill from trauma and are working on helping her stay grounded and present (learning to self-soothe a bit, e.g., with mindfulness or grounding techniques) when those feelings come, rather than immediately resorting to cutting. This is still very challenging for her, but the formulation explicitly validates how scary those feelings are – “like falling into an abyss” as she described – which is why cutting or threatening suicide has been her emergency exit.

In summary, our mid-therapy case formulation is that Aisha’s intense fear of abandonment and deep shame, originating from severe early abuse and neglect, are the core drivers of her emotional dysregulation and self-destructive behaviors ￼. Her personality structure (BPD) can be understood as a set of adaptations (splitting, clinging, outbursts, self-harm) aimed at surviving in a world she perceives as unsafe and at managing unbearable feelings of loneliness and self-loathing. The therapeutic task is to help her experience those core emotions in a tolerable way and develop new, more adaptive ways to get her attachment needs met and to soothe herself. Despite the hard road, by this stage Aisha has moments of reflecting on her patterns, and a small seed of hope has been planted that perhaps she isn’t inherently “evil” or doomed – rather, she has wounds that with time and care can heal, and she can learn to relate differently.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Early Therapy Dynamics: In the beginning, accessing Aisha’s core issues felt like navigating a minefield. Her extreme defenses and turbulent emotions made it hard to see past the immediate crises. Sessions often were consumed by the drama of the week – a fight with a friend, a crisis of feeling suicidal – which are of course critical to address. But this meant initially we were “firefighting” rather than delving into underlying patterns. For instance, the first few sessions were spent ensuring her safety after her breakup crisis and establishing some stability. During that time, she vehemently portrayed the ex-boyfriend as all bad, herself as either the victim or at fault in a global sense (“I ruin everything”). The specifics of her early life or her deeper feelings didn’t yet surface; they were eclipsed by the acute pain of the breakup and her defensive attributions (all blame on him, or all blame on self in a shameful way, but not yet exploring why these relationships follow the same script).

Mistrust and Testing: Aisha’s lack of trust in the therapist also obscured the core work initially. She would frequently test boundaries – for example, she’d send a barrage of texts between sessions then accuse the therapist of not caring if the response wasn’t immediate. These therapy-interfering behaviors had to be managed carefully. Early on, the sessions sometimes derailed into her interrogating “Do you actually care or are you going to drop me?” Her preoccupation with the immediate relationship with the therapist, while understandable, acted as both content and process: it is part of her core issue (fear of abandonment), but in-the-moment it could distract from talking about past experiences or patterns because we were dealing with a live enactment. It took time, validation, and consistency for her to start trusting the therapist’s intentions. Until that alliance solidified, she was understandably guarded about revealing vulnerable truths. For instance, when asked gently about her childhood, at first she gave a terse, sanitized summary like “I was in foster care, it sucked, whatever.” Only after some trust built did she slowly divulge specific painful memories (like hiding under the bed as a small child while her mom was passed out, or later, the abuse by a foster father). Those details were closely guarded initially; her avoidance and minimization of trauma was another barrier (she said at intake, “the past is the past, it’s people now who screw me over”). This indicated she wasn’t ready to go there until she felt safer.

Shame and Dissociation Blocking Insight: A significant way the core was hidden is through her shame and dissociation: when topics approached her own sense of self (“What do you feel it says about you when X leaves?”), sometimes she would go blank or change subject, or suddenly rage about the person instead. Her intense shame made it tormenting to reflect on herself with compassion; it was easier to either blame herself globally (“because I’m just a monster”) or blame others entirely than to calmly analyze the interplay. The all-or-nothing thinking (a product of splitting) initially hindered nuanced understanding. If the therapist tried to explore her role in a conflict, she might hear it as total blame on her and react defensively or despairingly. If we explored the other’s role, she might idealize me for “taking her side” and then fear I’d hate her if I knew how “bad” she really was. This tightrope had to be walked skillfully.

Emotional Overwhelm in Session: When we did start touching the raw core feelings, sometimes Aisha would become overwhelmed – trembling, sobbing, or conversely, zoning out – which indicated we hit a nerve but also meant we had to titrate the exposure to these feelings. Early on, if she even said “My mom left me,” she would then either dissociate or suddenly laugh harshly and say, “It doesn’t matter, I’m over it.” That nervous laugh and dismissal told me it did matter immensely, but she was overriding it because feeling it was too much. Essentially, the protective parts of her psyche would swoop in to block prolonged engagement with those childhood wounds, either by cutting off her feelings or by switching to anger. This is how the core stayed in the dark: her survival system was programmed to not dwell on those traumas because historically, she had no support to process them and it was safer to just react.

Therapy Ruptures Concealing Core: There were a couple of sessions in the early phase that ended abruptly due to ruptures – e.g., she walked out when she thought the therapist was siding with her ex. In those moments, crucial material about her fears might have been on the cusp, but the rupture halted the exploration. It required repair work in subsequent sessions to even get back to that point. These stops and starts meant unveiling the core was a nonlinear process.

Only after establishing a more stable therapeutic relationship and teaching/practicing some basic emotion regulation skills (so she wasn’t constantly at 10/10 intensity) could we consistently peer into the depths. Once she felt the therapist wasn’t going anywhere even if she showed her “ugly” sides, Aisha dared to let out more of her vulnerable feelings. She recounted in one mid-phase session, in a very small voice, “Sometimes I wake up and it’s like that little girl part of me is just crying for her mommy…and nobody’s there.” She had never said something like that before; it was a breakthrough of pure core grief and loneliness. She immediately followed it by saying “this is stupid” and wanting to self-harm for having said it – her shame flared up to punish the vulnerability. But the therapist’s steady compassion at that moment helped maintain the space. That moment illuminated how the deeply wounded child inside had been mostly hidden under layers of anger and bravado. It was a raw revelation of the core that had been there all along, beneath the defensive chaos.

In essence, Aisha’s core issues were initially shrouded by her chaotic surface – the storms of her day-to-day crises, her intense defenses (anger, blame, idealization/devaluation), and her own difficulty trusting and tolerating the therapeutic process. It’s taken patience, consistency, and a lot of empathy to gradually peel back those layers. Now, mid-therapy, those core vulnerable feelings (abandonment fear, shame, longing for love) are still volatile but at least they are acknowledged in the room, rather than being entirely acted out or avoided. This marks significant progress in making the implicit explicit, giving us a chance to work directly on healing those very deep wounds.

# Case8 – “David” (Hard Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 42 years old
	•	Gender: Male (he/him)
	•	Background: Senior manager at a financial firm. Married for 15 years, with two children (ages 12 and 10). David was raised in a highly demanding and affluent family; his father is a prominent surgeon, and his mother a socialite. He describes his upbringing as privileged but emotionally “cold” – affection was sparse, and achievement was paramount. David exhibits traits of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (though not formally diagnosed), such as grandiosity, a strong need for admiration, and difficulty with empathy. He is in therapy under pressure from his wife, who threatens separation due to his anger outbursts, emotional unavailability, and an affair he had a year ago.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Conditional love → fragile self‑esteem → defensive grandiosity/anger. Triggers (critique/failure) re‑activate shame → rage/deflection; affair as maladaptive self‑esteem regulation. Naming hurt beneath anger improves marital exchanges; grief over lack of unconditional love begins to surface.
- **Emotional Style:** Controlled/guarded affect; intellectualization; narcissistic rage when ego threatened.
- **Defenses (common):** Controlled/guarded affect; intellectualization; narcissistic rage when ego threatened. Denial/minimization, externalization, devaluation, rationalization, arrogance, avoidance of vulnerability; identification with critical father.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: David enters therapy with visible reluctance and a defensive posture. He initially says he’s come “to fix my marriage, because my wife is unhappy with me for some reason.” His presenting complaints, as he articulates them, center on stress: he mentions feeling constantly criticized at home despite his professional success, and admits to episodes of irritability and anger (yelling at his wife and kids). His wife’s perspective (from what he shares) is that he belittles her feelings, is overly critical of the children, and seems self-centered – he often makes everything about him. David acknowledges he had an affair, but downplays it (“a stupid fling, it meant nothing”). He shows little overt remorse, more frustration that his wife “can’t get over it” and keeps “throwing it in his face.” He also notes he’s been feeling low in energy and somewhat down since the affair came to light and his father’s recent health scare, though he doesn’t label it as depression. Initially, David is resistant to introspection: he tends to externalize blame (e.g., “My wife overreacts, my kids are too sensitive, work is demanding – anyone would blow up”). He also appears somewhat grandiose in session, emphasizing his accomplishments and subtly challenging the therapist’s credentials. However, beneath the bravado, there are signs of fragility: when he describes a recent fight where his wife called him “a selfish narcissist,” his face flushes and he looks momentarily hurt, though he quickly masks it with indignation.

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Underneath David’s combative, arrogant exterior lies a deeply insecure and fragile self-esteem. The core emotional pain for David centers on shame – a fundamental sense of not being “enough” – and fear – specifically, fear of failure or being seen as inferior ￼. Growing up, love in his family was conditional: affection and approval were tied to performance and image. As a boy, David learned that making mistakes or showing weakness led to criticism or withdrawal of love. He internalized a belief: “If I am not perfect or the best, I am nothing.” This belief is intrinsically tied to shame – any shortcoming triggers a sense of worthlessness and humiliation (though he often isn’t consciously aware of it, as it’s quickly covered with defenses). He also carries an emotional wound of feeling unseen and unloved for his true self. His parents provided materially but emotionally he often felt empty – like he was only valued for what he achieved, not for who he was. This translates into a persistent, if unconscious, hunger for validation to fill an internal void. Thus, the maladaptive emotion scheme at his core is one of deficient self-worth: a combination of shame (“there’s something flawed or unlovable in me unless I prove otherwise”) and envy or anger when others don’t accord him the respect/recognition he craves (because it pricks that shame). He is extremely sensitive to any perception of criticism or inadequacy ￼ – those moments strike at the heart of his old wound of never being good enough for his father. Additionally, there is fear of abandonment/rejection woven in: if he is not impressive or if he shows vulnerability, he fears he will lose love (much as he felt emotionally “abandoned” by disapproving parents when he didn’t measure up). This fear isn’t as overt as in someone like Aisha (Case 7), but it underlies his desperation to maintain a superior image.

Maladaptive Schemes: David’s primary maladaptive schema can be described as a “I must be exceptional to have worth” schema. This includes beliefs like “Success = worth, Failure = humiliation” and “Others should recognize and admire my special qualities or they are devaluing me.” Another schema involves distrust/hyper-competitiveness: he tends to see relationships in terms of who’s on top. This likely sprang from early experiences of his father’s dominance and conditional regard. As a result, he’s always in a stance of needing to prove himself and one-up others, which is maladaptive interpersonally. We can also identify a schema of emotional suppression: emotions (especially tender ones) were seen as weakness in his household, so he learned to suppress vulnerability (sadness, fear) and only show certain affects (confidence, anger). So, while less obvious than shame, there’s an underlying grief in David – grief of never having felt accepted as a child – which he has buried under achievement and pride.

Because of these schemes, David is caught in a painful loop: his genuine need for affirmation and love is high, but his strategies (boasting, being critical, seeking external status) often alienate the very people whose validation he wants. This leads to a cycle of never truly feeling satiated; no success is enough to soothe the inner doubt for long. The affair he had can be seen as an attempt to get a self-esteem boost and attention to fill that void – maladaptive coping with his emptiness and need for admiration. The consequence (his wife’s anger and potential loss of his marriage) then actually aggravates his core fears: now he indeed faces rejection and being seen as failing at marriage, which strikes at his shame. Thus, his irritability and defensiveness have ramped up, as those are his go-to defenses when core pain is near the surface.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: David’s emotional presentation is largely controlled, guarded, and oriented toward maintaining an appearance of confidence. He generally does not show vulnerable emotions like fear, sadness, or guilt openly – in fact, he may not even let himself fully feel those internally, due to long habit of suppressing them. Instead, his emotional repertoire in relationships tends to be anger/irritation, impatience, and sometimes charm or enthusiasm when he’s in a good mood or seeking approval. He is often intellectualizing; he talks about feelings in a detached, analytical way or redirects to facts and logic rather than directly experiencing them. For example, rather than saying “I felt hurt when my wife said that,” he might say, “It was unreasonable of her to say that, given the circumstances,” keeping the focus on right/wrong rather than his inner state. This suggests an overregulated emotional style – he tightly manages his affect to avoid showing weakness. However, when his self-esteem is threatened, emotion can burst out in less controlled ways, particularly narcissistic rage. If he perceives disrespect or criticism, a disproportionate anger flares. In session, when gently confronted with inconsistencies in his story, one could see a flash of defensiveness or sarcasm – signs that his emotions are not as completely under wraps as he’d like. Those flashes of rage or contempt are part of his style too, especially with those close to him, and serve to push them away when he’s uncomfortable (which inadvertently protects him from having to feel smaller or at fault).

Defensive Mechanisms: David employs a suite of classic defenses to maintain his grandiose self-image and ward off shame. Key defenses include denial, projection, externalization of blame, devaluation of others, rationalization, and arrogance as a defensive posture.
	•	Denial/Minimization: He often downplays his own harmful behaviors or mistakes (e.g., calling the affair “meaningless,” minimizing the impact on his wife) – this is denial in service of avoiding guilt/shame. He also minimizes others’ emotions (“she’s overreacting”), which is a way to not deal with the legitimacy of their hurt (and thus not face his role in causing it).
	•	Externalization of blame: David has a reflex of blaming circumstances or other people for problems. For instance, if he loses his temper, it’s because the kids were misbehaving or the wife provoked him, never purely his own inability to cope. If a project at work fails, he’ll emphasize a subordinate’s errors. This preserves his self-concept of competence and rightness. It’s easier for him to see others as inadequate than to sit with the notion that he could be.
	•	Devaluation of others: In line with narcissistic defenses, David often mentally (or verbally) demeans others to feel superior. For example, he might think his wife is “too emotional” (thus her grievances are less valid) or that coworkers are idiots if they challenge him. This devaluation protects him from feeling “one-down.” When someone points out his flaws, his mind immediately finds a flaw in them to even the score or flip the superiority. This was seen in therapy when at first he tried to subtly question the therapist’s expertise – a way of not feeling one-down in the patient role.
	•	Intellectualization/Rationalization: David is skilled at explaining away problems with logical excuses or high-level principles. Confronted about yelling at his son, he might launch into a discourse on how children today lack discipline and he’s trying to instill responsibility. These rationalizations coat his aggressive behavior in a veneer of reasonableness, shielding him from confronting the emotional truth that he was overly harsh because of his own issues.
	•	Arrogance and Humor: He sometimes uses grandiose statements or sarcastic humor as a shield. His arrogance (“I know better than the so-called experts” or bragging about his successes) is a proactive defense – he asserts his superiority so no one can question it first. His humor, especially if self-deprecating in a superficial way (“Yeah, guess I’m the evil husband, huh?” said jokingly), can disarm criticism by preemptively saying it himself, but without truly accepting it – it’s a distancing move.
	•	Avoidance of vulnerability: Whenever conversation nears sensitive areas – like his father’s approval or his feelings of inadequacy – David tends to shift focus or become restless. He might interrupt with something tangential or suddenly remember a work email he needs to send, etc. This avoidance indicates how threatening those topics are to his psyche.

Interestingly, David also exhibits some identification with the aggressor: He has taken on traits of his critical father, likely because as a child that gave him a sense of power (better to align with the powerful figure than be crushed by him). So he can be critical and demanding just as his father was, repeating the cycle. This is a defense in that it protects him from ever feeling as small as he did back then – now he’s in the father’s shoes (at least in his perception).

In summary, David’s defense system is about preserving a sense of esteem and control at all times. When that system is working, he appears confident, albeit a bit self-important and insensitive. When that system is challenged (critique, failure, rejection), it kicks into overdrive, resulting in anger, blame, and devaluation to restore his equilibrium.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: By the midpoint of therapy, David (to his own surprise) has gained some insight into the less obvious drivers of his marital and emotional problems. The formulation that has emerged is that David’s chronic anger, marital strife, and inner emptiness stem from a long-standing fragile self-esteem and fear of inadequacy that originated in his childhood experiences of conditional love and high criticism ￼. We conceptualize that David’s outward arrogance and defensiveness are essentially a protective shell around a deeply vulnerable core that feels not good enough and fears rejection if exposed ￼.

Through careful, often indirect exploration (since direct confrontation triggers his defenses), David has started to connect some dots. For instance, we linked a recent blow-up at his son (for getting a B grade) to the way his own father would react to him in similar situations. In session, David recalled a specific memory: coming in second in a science fair at 12 and his father saying, “Why didn’t you win? Second place is first loser.” He admitted feeling crushed and desperately wanting his dad’s approval. This memory was an emotional tipping point – he became teary (a rare event) and then quickly angry, saying, “I swore I’d never be a loser like that again.” We paused on that, and he could see how this schema of needing to be the best was forged. The formulation now includes that whenever David’s children don’t excel, or when his wife points out a flaw, it resurrects that old shame from being “second place” in his father’s eyes – hence his disproportionate rage or defensiveness.

We’ve framed his narcissistic behaviors in terms of underlying pain: for example, the affair was conceptualized not as him simply being a selfish jerk (the surface view), but as him seeking affirmation and escape from feelings of failure (at that time, he was feeling criticized at home and his father had just commented that he’s not as financially successful as some peers – a double hit to his ego). The affair partner showered him with admiration, temporarily soothing his wounded self. When David saw it in this light, he grew quiet and said, “So… I was basically so hungry for someone to make me feel good that I blew up my life?” – a rare moment of genuine self-reflection and sadness. This indicates he’s starting to grasp the emotional logic behind his actions instead of solely justifying them.

The formulation also addresses his marriage: We identified that he often misinterprets his wife’s requests or complaints through the lens of criticism = I’m failing = I’m not worthy. For example, if she says, “You’re not listening to me,” he hears “you’re a bad husband” which hits his shame, and he reacts with anger or withdrawal. This has been enlightening for him – he realized he often doesn’t actually hear what she’s asking for because he’s too busy reacting to what he imagines it means about him.

We’ve introduced the concept that anger is a secondary emotion for him, often covering hurt or insecurity ￼. One session, after much building rapport, I gently suggested that his quickness to anger when feeling disrespected might be covering a feeling of being hurt or small. He was resistant at first (“I’m not sensitive like that”), but later that week he reported an incident where he caught himself – his wife remarked he forgot to pick up something, he started to get angry, but then recognized he felt ashamed for forgetting and fearing she’d think less of him. Instead of lashing out, he (awkwardly) admitted, “I hate that I forgot; I feel like an idiot.” He said his wife responded more kindly than usual, and it defused the fight. He was surprised that being a bit vulnerable didn’t result in scorn. This real-life experiment reinforced our formulation: when he addresses the underlying feeling (shame/hurt) instead of defaulting to anger, outcomes improve.

Another layer of the formulation involves his sense of emptiness or lack of fulfillment despite success. We’ve discussed how no amount of external achievement sticks because the internal void is an emotional one left from childhood – he’s never internalized a steady sense of “I’m loveable even if I’m not perfect.” We’re working on him acknowledging and experiencing that grief – the grief of not having had unconditional love. In a breakthrough moment, David admitted he envies how freely his own children receive affection (something he finds himself withholding unless they “earn” it, repeating the cycle). He got choked up saying, “I don’t think I ever heard ‘I love you no matter what’ as a kid.” Recognizing that hurt as valid (rather than dismissing it as weakness) is part of transforming his schema.

We’ve encapsulated the case formulation as follows to him: “It seems you learned early that you had to be exceptional to earn love, and that showing weakness would bring you shame or rejection. So you built this armor of success and confidence. It protects you, but it also isolates you – it pushes away the people you love and keeps you always on guard. When that armor gets dented by criticism or mistakes, it feels unbearable – hence the anger. The real you inside is still that young boy craving acceptance and fearing he’s not good enough.” He didn’t love hearing this (it touched a nerve), but he didn’t reject it outright. He sighed and said quietly, “That… sounds pretty accurate, unfortunately.” This acceptance is a significant step – it means he’s not just blaming others, he’s starting to see his own patterns and where they come from.

Our mid-phase understanding is that David’s narcissistic defenses are slowly lowering to reveal the insecure, hurt self beneath, and therapy is helping him acknowledge those feelings and learn healthier ways to cope and connect. His relationship with his wife is cautiously improving as he practices more listening and owning up to faults (though it’s two steps forward, one back). Importantly, the formulation gives him a path: transforming that core shame by developing self-compassion and tolerating being “imperfect” yet still lovable. We emphasize that fear and shame are common in such scenarios ￼, normalizing it so he feels less uniquely flawed. In essence, the case formulation offers him a more compassionate lens on himself: not as an irredeemable villain or perpetual victim, but as a person shaped by early experiences, now capable of change by healing that core emotional wound.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Initial Resistance and Image Management: At therapy’s start, David’s core issues were well-concealed behind his polished persona and defensive posturing. He was very invested in presenting a certain image – competent, rational, maybe a bit victimized by over-emotional family members, but not emotionally troubled himself. This impression management meant he initially spoke in intellectual terms, focusing on surface conflicts. If the therapist gently probed feelings (like “How did you feel when your wife said she’s unsatisfied?”), he’d pivot to pragmatic aspects (“I told her I’ll try to be home earlier. Anyway, feelings won’t solve anything, right?”). This avoidance of feeling talk kept the deep stuff hidden. He essentially rationalized or sidestepped anything that would imply vulnerability.

Blame and External Focus: In early sessions, David’s narrative was all about others’ issues – his wife’s alleged oversensitivity, the kids’ discipline, his demanding job, etc. This external focus served as a barrier; as long as we were discussing others, we weren’t looking at his inner struggles. Any suggestion that his reactions might have deeper roots was initially met with slight irritation or dismissal. For example, when I remarked it seems he doesn’t like being wrong, he bristled and said, “Well, who does? But I don’t make it an issue, I just like things done right.” He was deflecting away the notion that it’s a particular trigger for him rooted in ego threat.

Therapeutic Alliance: Building an alliance was somewhat slow – he was polite but a bit aloof, perhaps testing whether I was competent enough for him to respect. He made a few tongue-in-cheek remarks like, “How’s all this supposed to help? I’m not really the therapy type.” This indicated a defensive skepticism; admitting therapy could help him meant admitting he had emotional problems, which challenged his self-view. So, he kept the process at arm’s length, which initially limited depth. Only after he encountered some consequences (like his wife talking separation seriously) and after I maintained a respectful stance (acknowledging his intellect and insights before delving into emotions) did he start to engage more openly.

Shame’s Invisible Cloak: David’s shame is like an invisible cloak – powerful but hidden. Unlike someone who overtly says “I feel worthless,” David’s shame showed up in subtle ways: overcompensating bragging, getting unusually angry at mild critique, or momentarily blank expressions when asked about personal failures. Those blanks were telling; for instance, I once asked, “What was it like when your father said he was disappointed you didn’t get into Ivy League?” David paused, opened his mouth, then said flatly, “It was a long time ago, I don’t remember. Anyway, I got over it and proved myself later.” That quick gloss-over signaled a lot: he likely did remember (the pause suggested feeling), but it was too painful to articulate, so the shame shut it down, and he pivoted to a mastery narrative. Thus, the core hurt was hidden behind his story of later triumph. Recognizing such patterns took time.

Cognitive Empathy Gap: Initially, he also had a hard time acknowledging others’ feelings in a genuine way, which hindered reflection on his effect on them and thus on exploring his motivations. For example, he described his wife’s distress with a kind of perplexed tone, not truly empathizing. This lack of empathy (a narcissistic feature) made it tricky to use his family’s feedback as a mirror for him. He’d chalk it up to their issues. It took some creative strategy – like referencing how his children might feel in terms he could understand (like the competition aspect at school) – to get him to consider emotional perspectives. Until he did, the conversation stayed superficial and one-sided, concealing the mutual emotional wounds in his marriage and his own stake in them.

Grandiosity as Shield: His grandiosity was also a shield. He would highlight successes or good intentions to overshadow any flaws. Mentioning his affair, he quickly appended how he provides well for his family, as if to balance scales. This tit-for-tat listing of virtues vs. mistakes prevented delving into why the affair happened emotionally. If I tried to steer towards his emotional state during that time, he diverted to logistical or blame aspects (“We weren’t even intimate then, so what did she expect…”). The grandiose self-image doesn’t like to dwell on personal failings, so therapy risked colliding with that. I had to approach it by acknowledging positives first (“I see how much you pride yourself on providing”) before touching the vulnerable areas. Otherwise, the door closed.

It was only after a particularly tense session where his wife’s potential departure became real to him (he mentioned she contacted a lawyer) that he had what I call a “narcissistic injury” in therapy – he teared up unexpectedly while talking about possibly not seeing his kids every day. That crack in the armor allowed a brief glimpse of the frightened, sad David underneath. He quickly recovered, wiping his eye and saying “I just have a lot on my mind.” But I gently noted that it makes sense he’d be upset – that losing family time is a scary thought for anyone. He didn’t verbally agree then, but the lack of argument told me I hit truth. After that, he was slightly more open to discussing feelings, perhaps because he realized the stakes.

In summary, initially David’s core insecurity was masked by intellectualizations, blame, and displays of confidence, as well as a reluctance to trust the therapeutic process. The therapy had to earn its credibility with him and had to carefully validate his perspective even as it introduced alternative views. Once he felt I respected him (and wasn’t out to tear him down like a critic), he gradually allowed more self-scrutiny. The pivotal shift was him beginning to see that acknowledging vulnerability wouldn’t be met with scorn in this environment, unlike in his past. That created cracks in the defenses. Bit by bit, the compassionate formulation of his behavior – framing it not as pure ego or malice but as an adaptation to emotional wounds – made it safe enough for him to look at those wounds. Now, the core feelings of shame and fear are still tender for him to discuss, but at least they’re not completely hidden in the therapy; he has started to name them (in limited ways) and examine how they drive his actions, which is significant progress from where we began.

# Case9 – “Marcus” (Hard Difficulty)

## Profile
	•	Age: 34 years old
	•	Gender: Male (he/him)
	•	Background: Marcus is a military veteran (served in combat overseas) and now works as a security guard. He grew up in a series of foster homes after being removed from his biological family due to chronic neglect and domestic violence. He has a history of complex PTSD from both childhood abuse and war-zone trauma. Marcus is divorced; his marriage ended two years ago largely due to his emotional withdrawal and bouts of anger (no children). He lives alone and has limited social support. He has struggled with alcohol misuse in the past (binge drinking to cope), though he claims he’s cut back recently. Marcus presents with features of avoidant personality traits – he keeps people at a distance and has difficulty trusting others. He’s coming to therapy at the urging of a VA counselor to specifically address his pervasive numbness, isolation, and underlying despair.

### Quick Reference (from case brief)
- **Cycle Map:** Emotional shutdown and withdrawal are survival adaptations; numb protects from “feeling everything.” Nightmares/intrusions signal unprocessed fear/grief.
- **Emotional Style:** Blunted affect/baseline numbing with episodic flooding; dissociation near trauma content.
- **Defenses (common):** Blunted affect/baseline numbing with episodic flooding; dissociation near trauma content. Avoidance (people, memories), isolation, hypervigilance, resigned pessimism; past substance use.

## Presenting Problem

Initial Presentation: Marcus describes himself as feeling “empty and disconnected from everyone”. He says he often goes through life on “autopilot,” feeling numb, with occasional eruptions of intense emotion that he usually keeps hidden. His primary complaints are: inability to feel happiness or love (“even when good things happen, I feel nothing”), difficulty sleeping due to nightmares (some combat-related, some involving childhood memories), and a strong impulse to isolate (“I avoid people; I don’t want to burden or be hurt by anyone”). He also admits to passive suicidal ideation at times, saying it “wouldn’t matter” if he didn’t wake up. At the same time, he shows up to work and obligations, almost robotically. Co-workers have noted he’s distant and hard to get to know. Marcus presents as very reserved in session; he answers questions tersely, avoids eye contact, and often says “I don’t know” when asked about feelings. However, he clearly is in pain, evidenced by a heavy sadness in his eyes and the way he occasionally trembles when discussing certain topics. Initially, he frames his problem as “I’m broken. I feel nothing or I feel panic – nothing in between. Maybe I’m just too messed up from everything that happened.” He expresses doubt that therapy can help, noting “Talking about stuff doesn’t change what happened.” This indicates a sense of hopelessness and also a fear of delving into trauma.

## Underlying Emotional Pain and Maladaptive Scheme(s)

Core Emotional Pain: Marcus’s core emotional pain is anchored in profound trauma-related fear, grief, and shame – essentially the emotional residue of severe attachment wounds and life-threatening experiences ￼ ￼. In childhood, being neglected and witnessing violence taught him the world is unsafe and that he is insignificant/unloved. This created a deep fear of trust and intimacy (anyone close can hurt or abandon you) and an enduring sadness of abandonment – a lonely grief for the care he never received. As a combat veteran, he also carries traumatic fear and guilt from war (he lost close friends in combat and blames himself for some of it). The combination of these has resulted in a core sense of “I am alone in a dangerous world, and I probably don’t deserve better”. Marcus rarely feels this pain in a straightforward way; it’s often buried under layers of numbness or flashes of trauma memories. But at his core, there is a childhood emotional schema: fear (anticipating harm, betrayal) and shame (feeling unlovable and broken from the early abandonment) ￼. There is also complicated grief – not only for lost comrades, but implicitly for the loss of his childhood and family. Another element of pain is moral injury from war – he hasn’t said it outright, but hints at regretful things (“I did things I try not to think about”). That likely contributes to shame and self-condemnation (feeling like a “bad person” perhaps). All together, Marcus’s pain is that of someone who has never felt secure or valued, and who has seen humanity at its worst, leaving him with a shattered sense of meaning and connection.

Maladaptive Schemes: One major maladaptive schema for Marcus is “Attachment = Pain” (or “If I get close to someone, I will get hurt or cause hurt”). This comes from repeated early experiences of caregivers either directly harming him or failing to protect him, and later life reinforcing it (friends killed in war, his wife eventually leaving). Therefore, he believes staying detached is the only safety. This leads to an avoidant coping style – emotionally numbing himself and avoiding relationships – which sadly keeps his core loneliness and trauma unaddressed ￼. Another schema is “Emotions are dangerous/unbearable”. Emotions in childhood went unsoothed or were overwhelming (fear seeing his father beat his mother, etc.), and in war they were similarly overwhelming (terror, loss). So he learned to shut them off (numbing, dissociation) as a primary survival mechanism ￼ ￼. Now, any strong feeling tends to trigger either panic or shut-down, as he lacks a template for moderate, manageable emotional experience.

There’s also a schema of self-blame and worthlessness: as a child he likely thought “It’s my fault” (common for kids in abuse) and “I must be worthless to be treated like this.” As an adult, this persists subtly – e.g., he says “I’m broken, messed up” frequently, showing he identifies with being fundamentally defective, not just someone who has problems, but someone who is the problem.

His combat trauma adds a layer of pervasive threat perception: he can’t fully relax, always somewhat hypervigilant (which contributes to isolation; crowds or intimacy might trigger anxiety). Also, survivor guilt might be part of his pain (though he hasn’t voiced it yet).

These schemes result in his daily life pattern: keep head down, don’t feel, don’t connect, because the internal logic is feeling or connecting will either overwhelm me or end in loss. It’s maladaptive because it prevents corrective experiences (he’s not letting in potentially positive relationships) and it doesn’t truly heal the pain (numbness just covers it). It also contributes to a potential risk of suicidality, as feeling nothing and believing nothing will ever change can lead to despair.

## Emotional Style and Defensive Mechanisms

Emotional Style: Marcus’s emotional style is characterized by blunted affect, avoidance of emotional expression, and episodes of dysregulated emotion under extreme stress. Most of the time he presents as flat, detached – he’s essentially in a constant state of emotional overregulation (overcontrolled, suppressed) as a baseline ￼. He actively tries not to feel or show feelings. When he does have emotions, they often manifest somatically (e.g., tension, stomach issues) or slip out in small clues (a trembling hand, a tear he quickly wipes away). However, because he cannot completely eliminate feelings, he occasionally has intrusive bursts: nightmares, sudden panic attacks when triggered (like hearing a loud noise reminiscent of gunfire), or unexpected anger (he mentioned once punching a wall when alone after a frustrating day – an anger he never showed to others directly). These indicate that underneath the numbing, there’s a well of intense emotion (fear, rage) that leaks out when he’s overwhelmed. So his style vacillates between numbness and flooding, with little middle ground – typical of someone with complex trauma who hasn’t learned to modulate affect. Also, he tends to dissociate when discussing trauma – he’ll go blank or seem far away, indicating an emotional shutdown as we approach painful territory.

Defensive Mechanisms: Marcus’s psyche utilizes a range of defenses primarily aimed at preventing re-traumatization and avoiding emotional overwhelm. Key defenses include emotional numbing/dissociation, avoidance (behavioral and cognitive), isolation, pessimistic resignation, and substance use (previously).
	•	Numbing/Dissociation: This is perhaps his main defense. He has essentially numbed himself to survive. In therapy, when asked about feelings, he often says “I don’t feel anything” or “I don’t know.” It’s not dishonesty; he truly has difficulty accessing emotion because for so long his mind’s survival strategy was to cut feelings off ￼. Dissociation (a step beyond numbing) happens when something touches on heavy trauma: his eyes glaze, he may lose track of what we were saying. This automatic shutdown protected him during extreme trauma (both childhood and combat) – an extreme version of freeze response. Now it kicks in even when we just approach those memories.
	•	Avoidance: Marcus avoids any reminders of trauma or any situation that requires vulnerability. He mentioned he avoids news (could trigger war memories), avoids relationships (triggers trust issues), and even avoids thinking about the past (tries to “block it out”). This avoidance is classic PTSD behavior – it keeps him from triggers ￼, but also from processing or healing. In therapy, avoidance shows up as changing topics, deflecting with “I don’t know,” or intellectualizing (though he doesn’t do heavy intellectualization, more just minimal answers).
	•	Social Isolation: This is a behavioral defense – by keeping people at distance, he ensures no one can hurt or leave him. It’s also partly due to feeling he can’t relate to “normal” people after what he’s been through (a belief often found in trauma survivors). While isolation protects him from potential interpersonal pain, it sadly also reinforces his belief that he’s alone and unlovable.
	•	Resigned/Cynical Attitude: Marcus often speaks in a hopeless tone (“nothing will change,” “I’m just messed up and that’s how it is”). This cynicism is a defense against hope – if he doesn’t hope, he can’t be disappointed. It’s an emotional dampening strategy: expecting the worst as a way to avoid feeling the sting of wanting better and not getting it. It’s also a form of self-protection: if he labels himself irredeemable, he preempts others from making that judgment (kind of self-deprecating shield).
	•	Substance Use: In the past, and possibly still occasionally, alcohol was a big defense – it’s a classic avoidance/numbing tool. He would drink to blot out nightmares or to feel some semblance of relief. He says he’s reduced this, which suggests he’s trying to not rely on it, but the urge is likely there in rough times.
	•	Hypervigilance and Control: Though not as overtly mentioned, likely he’s always scanning for threats (learned from trauma). This means he probably sits in therapy facing the door, notes every sound, etc. That hypervigilance is a defense to feel in control and not be caught off guard again – a way to fight the powerlessness he once had. It also means relaxation or spontaneous joy is hard (because guard is never fully down).

All these defenses create a fortress of solitude around Marcus – they kept him alive mentally when he had no safe relational harbor, but now they imprison him in a state of perpetual emotional lockdown ￼. The therapy aims to gently encourage him to gradually let down these defenses in a safe context, so that the underlying wounds can be acknowledged and healed.

## Case Formulation (Mid-Phase Understanding)

Emerging Formulation: By mid-therapy, Marcus and I have developed a tentative but growing understanding of how his life experiences have shaped his current numbness and isolation. The case formulation can be summarized as: Marcus’s emotional shutdown and interpersonal withdrawal are survival strategies developed in response to chronic trauma and loss, leaving him with unprocessed fear, grief, and shame that he keeps at bay through avoidance and numbing ￼ ￼.

Over time, Marcus has slowly opened up about key events. We mapped out his trauma history – from early childhood abuse (he revealed a memory of being locked in a closet for hours by a foster parent as punishment) to specific combat incidents (he described, in a detached tone, an IED explosion that killed two friends). In doing so, Marcus mostly intellectualized the narratives initially, but I noticed tremors and emotion in his voice at certain points. We pointed these out gently: for instance, when mentioning the foster closet incident, his leg was bouncing rapidly. I noted, “Your leg is shaking as you talk about that; I wonder what feeling is coming up.” He at first said “Nothing, it’s fine,” but later admitted “Maybe I’m nervous or something.” A crack in the door.

The formulation recognizes that Marcus learned early on that showing emotion or needing help resulted in nothing or further harm, so he adapted by dissociating (feeling “nothing”) and never asking for help ￼. We discuss this openly: that as a child no one comforted him when he was scared, so those feelings had nowhere to go – he had to swallow them. Now, as an adult, it’s like he still carries those frozen feelings. Marcus has resonated a bit with this idea; he once said, “Yeah, I guess there’s no point in crying if no one’s gonna hear you.” That was both a sad acknowledgment and a tiny step of insight into how his belief was formed.

We have also identified his core beliefs/schemas in therapy terms, and he’s beginning to see them: e.g., “I don’t trust anyone” and “I’m on my own.” We tied this to multiple betrayals (parents, foster system, even feeling betrayed by the “promises” of the military or government perhaps). He’s starting to understand that these beliefs, while justified by his past, might not be absolute truths in the present. For example, he initially was very wary of me as a therapist (likely expecting judgment or harm), but as I consistently responded with empathy, he’s been somewhat surprised. At one point he said, “You don’t think I’m crazy or evil?” and I affirmed I see him as a survivor doing his best. That nearly brought tears – a sign that some part of him is hungry for a different narrative, where he isn’t just “broken.” So our formulation includes that his self-concept (broken, beyond help) is itself a scar of trauma, not a fact.

We’ve drawn the connection between his numbness and trauma avoidance: basically, that feeling nothing is a way his mind protects him from feeling everything (pain, terror) ￼. I used a metaphor he related to: it’s like he’s put all his painful memories and feelings in a strong box and locked it – effective for short term, but it’s heavy to carry and nothing new can get in or out. He actually followed that metaphor, adding “Yeah… I threw that box in the ocean.” I gently countered, “Yet it still drags you down from beneath, doesn’t it?” He nodded silently. That metaphorical conversation indicated he knows the numbness isn’t actually gone – it’s submersed pain.

Crucially, we’ve recognized some emotion when it does appear: he has cried softly exactly once, speaking about a buddy from his unit who died saving others. He said, voice cracking, “He was… a good man.” Then he shut down, looked away. I responded by staying quiet and present, which he later told me he appreciated (he said, “Thanks for not pushing me then”). It seems giving him permission to feel just a bit without pushing or judging was validating. Our formulation emphasizes that these tears and even his nightmares are signs the pain is still alive inside needing acknowledgment ￼. I framed his nightmares as his mind trying to process what his waking self avoids. He hadn’t thought of it that way – he’s beginning to see them not as “curses” but as signals of unresolved feelings.

We’ve also touched on his survivor’s guilt. When I gently hypothesized he might blame himself for some things that weren’t his fault (like his friends’ deaths or even his mother’s failures), he was quiet for a long time and then said, “Maybe. I don’t know how not to, though.” That acknowledgment tells us guilt is a big part of his shame schema. The formulation now includes that forgiving himself and realizing the abuse/traumas were not because he deserved them is a healing target.

Interpersonally, he has slowly started to test connection: he joined a trauma support group at the VA (something he initially refused). He reports mostly listening there, but noted, “It’s weird hearing others say stuff I thought only I felt.” This is huge – it challenges his belief “I’m alone in this.” Our formulation highlights these corrective experiences: seeing that others care (like group members or therapist), and that sharing doesn’t always equal being attacked, can help rebuild trust piece by piece. Marcus is not one to gush about “progress,” but I note a small change: he no longer says “I’m beyond help” outright. Instead, he says “I’m not sure this will help.” That subtle shift from certainty to uncertainty about hopelessness is a win.

In summary, the mid-phase case conceptualization is that Marcus’s detachment and despair are understood as the result of cumulative relational trauma ￼, leading to strategies of emotional numbing, isolation, and fatalistic thinking as protection ￼. The work is in helping him safely contact and process his buried emotions (fear, grief, anger) from those traumas, and slowly update his beliefs about himself and others (e.g., not all people will harm him, he is worthy of support). We acknowledge that his symptoms (like nightmares, bursts of anger) are remnants of those unhealed wounds. This understanding is giving Marcus a bit more compassion for himself – he even said once, “I guess anyone who went through what I did would be messed up.” That’s a move from “I’m just messed up” to “given what happened, my reactions make sense” – a crucial reframing toward healing ￼. He’s not fully there yet, but the seed is planted.

## How Core Understanding Was Initially Hidden

Initial Wall of Avoidance: When therapy began, Marcus’s core inner world was obscured by his pervasive avoidance and emotional guardedness. He practically came in saying, “I don’t want to talk about the past,” which obviously is where the core issues lie. Respecting that, I focused first on present symptoms like sleep and general feelings. His responses were brief, factual, with little affect. It was like trying to see a room in darkness – he kept the lights off on his inner experience. My attempts at gentle probing (“What’s it like when you have a nightmare?”) were often met with shutdown (“I dunno, it’s just a dream, I wake up and it’s over.”). He was clearly uncomfortable with any detailed exploration, likely fearing being overwhelmed. So, the sessions initially felt somewhat stagnant, as if we were circling a fortress.

Trust Deficit: Marcus didn’t trust me (or anyone) initially – a product of his trauma. He likely expected judgment or that I couldn’t handle his truth. So he gave very little. If I asked about feelings or trauma, sometimes he’d change subject to, say, a neutral topic (like asking if I’ve worked with vets before – essentially testing me). Without trust, he wasn’t going to reveal or even acknowledge to himself the depth of his pain. As a result, early on, he spoke in generic terms: “Yeah, a lot of bad stuff happened, but I survived.” That stoic oversimplification hid layers of hurt. It took consistency and, interestingly, some self-disclosure (I carefully mentioned having worked with others with similar backgrounds, and knowing a bit about military culture) to slightly bridge the gap. Once he sensed I wasn’t completely outsider, he warmed maybe one degree.

Dissociation/Numbing in Session: In our first attempt to touch his childhood, I noticed he dissociated – his eyes looked away and he got very still and quiet. When I inquired if he’s okay, he said flatly, “I just don’t remember much, it’s whatever.” That was a red flag that we hit a too-sensitive spot and his defense took over, essentially hiding the emotional content from even his own conscious recall (common in trauma survivors). So initially, even he couldn’t access the core stuff clearly, let alone share it. A lot was implicit – I had to pick up on body language and indirect hints. This made the core issues (fear, hurt) invisible in discourse. It was present in the room as an absence, if that makes sense – like the weight of what’s unsaid.

Focusing on “nothing”: Marcus repeatedly said “I feel nothing” or “I’m just numb.” This was a challenge because it’s hard to work with “nothing” as a feeling. It’s a defense, but to him it was reality – he genuinely believed he had no feelings. Early sessions, I tried subtle approaches, e.g., “Sometimes feeling nothing is itself a sign of feeling too much underneath – like numb is a protective gear.” He shrugged that off (“Maybe, I don’t know”). He wasn’t ready to accept that. So the core fear, sorrow, etc., remained hidden behind this narrative of “nothingness.” Only after gradually building rapport did he start to say, “Sometimes I guess I do feel sad when I wake up from those nightmares.” That was one of the first admissions of an actual feeling. Getting that crack in the “nothing” narrative was crucial.

Negative Cognitions blocking core: He had strong negative cognitions that initially blocked exploring emotions – “It won’t help,” “I deserve this,” “Talking won’t change shit.” These beliefs made touching core emotions seem pointless or even dangerous to him (why open wounds if nothing can heal them?). Early on, a lot of our work was just me validating how understandable those thoughts are given his experiences, and lightly suggesting that we go slow and just see. Over time, seeing that I didn’t force him and didn’t get overwhelmed by his stories, he slowly engaged more. But those pessimistic beliefs acted like guardians at the gate of his core issues, saying “Don’t bother, no entry.”

Shame and fear of judgment: Though not overt, I suspect his shame (thinking of himself as messed up or maybe guilty for certain things in war) made him assume I’d judge him if I knew “everything.” So he withheld details, which in turn made it hard to directly address his guilt or self-blame. For instance, he casually said “I did things in the military I’m not proud of,” then changed subject. That statement hung in the air for weeks, unelaborated. I didn’t push for details, sensing his shame was profound there. It’s possible he thought if he told me, I’d recoil or scold. That secrecy kept his deep guilt locked away, and we instead danced around symptoms (like his self-loathing statements) without anchor initially. Only after reinforcing that I didn’t see him as a bad person repeatedly, did he hint more at what those things were. When he finally shared one event (following orders that led to civilian casualties), he was shaking and expecting me to declare him a monster. I responded with empathy for how awful that must have been for him. That seemed a relief; he exhaled and slumped as if a weight dropped – core guilt briefly surfaced and met acceptance, not judgment. That was a turning point but it took long to get there due to his protective silence.

Overwhelming Nature of Core: Lastly, the core is massive for Marcus. It’s not one incident or feeling; it’s layers of trauma and loneliness. At first, that mountain was too high to even approach – he was in survival mode, focusing just on getting through day by day. The idea of tackling all that was itself overwhelming. So, we had to break it into small pieces (one memory, one feeling at a time). Initially, anything beyond surface threatened to open the floodgates, so he’d retreat. Recognizing that was key; I learned not to pry too fast. For a while, the core remained hidden simply because it’s so extensive and heavy that revealing even a part risked avalanching him. Patience was necessary.

Now, at mid-therapy, there’s at least a map of the mountain and some paths in. We still tread carefully, but Marcus sometimes brings up bits of core material on his own (like mentioning feeling lonely on an anniversary of a battle). That is a big change – he’s gradually trusting that showing a bit of his pain won’t annihilate him or make me abandon him. The core fear and shame are more visible now, albeit still guarded. But they’re acknowledged as existing, rather than “nothing.” That shift from invisibility to visibility – however flickering – is allowing actual healing work to commence.
