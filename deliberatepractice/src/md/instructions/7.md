# Empathic Evocations in EFT – High-Quality Client Markers and Therapist Responses at Three Levels

Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT) uses Empathic Evocation to heighten a client’s present emotion through vivid, evocative reflections. This guide breaks down what high-quality client statements (markers) and high-quality therapist responses look like at the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced skill levels. Each section outlines key characteristics in clear bullet points and provides examples from training materials to illustrate these qualities. The goal is to help in generating new, varied, and realistic client–therapist pairs for deliberate practice, ensuring both the client markers and therapist responses align with the difficulty level and exemplify excellent empathic evocation.

## Beginner Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Beginner)

Beginner-level client statements for empathic evocation are straightforward, emotionally clear, and naturally invite vivid empathy. These markers typically involve one dominant feeling and often include simple imagery or colorful language the therapist can easily pick up on. Key features include:
- Direct, Strong Emotion: The client plainly expresses a basic emotion like hurt, anger, or shame, without much complexity or mixed feelings. This makes it obvious what emotion to empathically evoke.
- Everyday Imagery or Idioms: The language may include casual metaphors or idiomatic phrases that “lend themselves” to expansion. For example, a client might say “It made me feel so little” after a humiliating encounter ￼. Phrases like “so little,” “used,” or “boiling mad” give a vivid starting point for the therapist.
- Realistic and Relatable: The statements sound authentic – like something a real client would say in daily language. They are emotionally resonant (the trainee can imagine a real person feeling this way) and not overly polished or clinical.
- Not Fully Explored by the Client: The client’s comment reveals a clear feeling but doesn’t delve into it. This “open door” invites the therapist to explore and amplify the emotion. For instance, “I feel so taken advantage of by her, so used” ￼ plainly conveys anger and hurt, yet leaves room to deepen that feeling with an evocative response.
- Appropriate Simplicity: The content is suited to a beginner therapist – typically one emotional theme per statement. The trainee doesn’t have to decipher a complex narrative, so they can focus on crafting an empathic metaphor for the obvious feeling.

Example (Beginner Marker): “You should have seen how she glared at me. It made me feel so little.” ￼ – This believable statement conveys shame and hurt. It contains an implicit image (“felt so little” after a glare) that a therapist can vividly empathize with (e.g. feeling small or invisible). It’s a clear, single-emotion marker ideal for beginner practice.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Beginner)

At the beginner level, an empathic evocation response should model the skill in a clear, natural, and easy-to-imitate way. The therapist essentially reflects the client’s feeling back with a bit of punch – using simple metaphors or sensory language to heighten the emotion while staying true to the client’s experience. Key characteristics include:
- Vivid but Simple Metaphors: The therapist takes the client’s emotional words or imagery and mirrors them with a simile or metaphor that intensifies the feeling. For example, a therapist responding to the client who felt “so little” might say “Yeah, just so small, almost as if you weren’t there, you could just disappear.” ￼ This response stays empathic and natural (“Yeah, just so small”) and then amplifies the feeling of smallness into a vivid image of disappearing.
- Uses Client’s Own Language: High-quality responses often incorporate or extend the client’s phrasing, which keeps the empathy aligned with how the client actually feels. If a client says they feel “used,” the therapist might respond, “You feel kind of jerked around, like a yo-yo.” ￼ – picking up “used” and creatively elaborating it into a relatable metaphor of being toyed with.
- Emotionally Evocative Tone: The therapist’s tone is warm, validating, and a bit more expressive than a straightforward reflection. They communicate that they feel the client’s emotion. For instance, “Something about her accusing you … feels like a knife digging into you.” ￼ conveys not just the content (it feels unfair) but the sting of the accusation with the knife metaphor. The language is still everyday (not jargon) but it strikes a chord.
- Focused and Concise: Beginner-level evocations are usually one to two sentences, focusing on one core image. The therapist doesn’t pile on too much or shift to another topic. This makes it easy for trainees to emulate. An example from the training: “Just the sight of her makes you want to blow up!” ￼ – a single, punchy sentence that captures the client’s fury (building on the client saying the person “makes me furious”). It’s clear, powerful, yet simple.
- Congruent with the Client’s Feeling: A crucial quality is that the chosen metaphor or description matches the client’s emotion. The therapist stays in the client’s emotional world. If the client is hurt and shocked by someone hanging up on them, the therapist might say something like, “It’s like a door slammed in your face mid-conversation – leaving you stunned and hurt.” This kind of response (while not a direct quote from the text, it follows the principle) illustrates the hurt in a way the client can immediately recognize. A high-quality response does not introduce an off-target image or overdramatize in a way that the client wouldn’t agree with. The client should ideally respond, “Yes, that’s exactly how it feels,” feeling deeply understood.

By adhering to these principles, beginner-level responses clearly demonstrate empathic evocation without overwhelming the trainee. The therapist models how to go beyond a basic reflection (“You felt hurt”) and instead paint a relatable mini-picture of the feeling. This teaches trainees how emotionally evocative language (e.g. metaphors of invisibility, being a toy, being about to explode, etc.) can deepen the client’s contact with their own emotions in a safe, empathic manner.

## Intermediate Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Intermediate)

Intermediate client statements suitable for empathic evocation are more complex or nuanced, often containing multiple emotional threads or a hint of deeper, unresolved issues. They still naturally invite evocative empathy but require the therapist to tune in to subtleties. Key features of high-quality intermediate markers:
- Nuanced or Mixed Emotions: The client might express conflicting feelings or a layered emotional experience. For example, a client might convey intense love with a hint of unhealthy obsession, or anger entwined with hurt. One example from the training is “I love him so much that it’s hard to think of anything else.” ￼ – an obsessive love that borders on all-consuming. Another client might flatly state despair, “I just feel so worthless.” ￼, which is a simple sentence but carries profound self-loathing. Such markers go beyond basic emotions and give the therapist more to unpack.
- Implicit Depth or Conflict: An intermediate marker often alludes to deeper issues without explicitly exploring them. The client may hint at an unmet need or an internal conflict. For instance, “My boyfriend has been so unfaithful… I need to stop loving him.” (betrayal and resolve) or “She’s like the perfect girlfriend… I can even sleep with other girls!” (a situation with no boundaries, which sounds positive but is oddly unsettling) ￼. These statements imply complex dynamics – betrayal vs. longing, or love vs. the absence of limits – setting the stage for an evocative response that captures those dynamics.
- Longer or Contextual Statements: Compared to beginner markers, intermediate client statements might span a few sentences providing context. They remain realistic (clients do talk at length when emotional or conflicted) and contain concrete content the therapist can latch onto. For example, “…when he starts talking, I feel like I cannot get a word in… I just shut down.” ￼ gives a process description (“shutting down”) along with the trigger (partner dominates conversation). The therapist here must identify what aspect to vividly empathize with – likely the feeling of being silenced and defeated.
- Presence of Figurative Language or Bodily Feelings: The client might use some descriptive language themselves, indicating what they feel physically or metaphorically. For example, “it just leaves me with a strong, empty, churning feeling in my stomach.” ￼ (said when a father ignores the client) – the client already names a bodily sensation (“churning in my stomach”) and an emotional quality (“empty”). High-quality markers often have these kernels of imagery/sensation which a therapist can further amplify.
- Matched to Intermediate Difficulty: These statements are a step up in complexity. They are not so straightforward that the feeling is singular and obvious (like beginner level), but they’re also not completely opaque. They challenge the therapist to pick up on the most salient emotion or image and run with it. The client may show some self-awareness (“I know this is self-destructive but…”) or may intellectualize slightly, requiring the therapist to artfully bring the emotion into full color. In sum, the content is rich enough to need skillful distillation into an evocative response.

Example (Intermediate Marker): “I just wish my father would acknowledge my feelings… it leaves me with a strong, empty, churning feeling in my stomach.” ￼ – This is a high-quality intermediate marker because the client is describing a deep longing and resultant pain in both emotional and sensory terms. It’s believable and heartfelt. The mixed description of emptiness and churning in the stomach provides a vivid emotional cue. A therapist can work with that directly (e.g., empathically imagining how that “churning emptiness” feels) or use it to symbolize the client’s hurt. The statement isn’t fully processed by the client (it’s almost said in passing), which makes it ripe for the therapist to explore and deepen through empathic evocation.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Intermediate)

At the intermediate level, therapist responses in empathic evocation demonstrate more finely tuned creativity and integration. The therapist listens for the core of what the client is expressing – which might involve multiple feelings or an underlying theme – and responds with an evocative reflection that often weaves together those elements. Key characteristics include:
- Targeted, Multi-Element Imagery: An intermediate response often combines two or more facets of the client’s experience into one potent image or statement. The therapist might use a metaphor that captures a blend of feelings. For instance, for the client obsessively in love, the therapist responded, “You are so smitten, he has really rocked your world — just feels like nothing else matters.” ￼. Here “smitten” and “rocked your world” are somewhat colloquial yet vivid phrases that amplify the client’s love into an all-encompassing experience. It integrates the client’s words (“hard to think of anything else”) into an image of their world being shaken and narrowed down to one person.
- Use of First-Person and Inner Voice: A hallmark of many intermediate examples is the therapist speaking as if they were the client’s inner voice or deeper feeling, to convey unspoken aspects. For a client who said “I feel worthless,” the therapist expanded it: “It is like ‘I feel like such a nothing,’ like ‘I don’t deserve to exist,’ like wanting to shrink into the floor.” ￼. This response layers three similes in the first person (“I feel like…”) to capture the full extent of worthlessness – from self-contempt to a desire to vanish. Using the client’s perspective in this way is powerfully empathic; it’s as though the therapist is articulating what the client might be feeling deep down. The multiple “like…” phrases bombard the client with recognition from different angles (if one metaphor doesn’t resonate, another might), which is a more advanced empathetic skill but very effective.
- Acknowledging Mixed Feelings or Decisions: If the client’s statement contains conflict or a turning point, the therapist’s evocation will reflect that complexity in simple terms. For example, a client resolved to stop loving an unfaithful partner – the therapist said, “Somehow you feel so betrayed, so taken advantage of, and it is a feeling of ‘This is where I draw the line!’” ￼. This response empathically mirrors both the hurt (“betrayed, taken advantage of”) and the firm resolve (“draw the line”) using the client’s implied decision. The evocative phrase “draw the line” turns that resolve into an image of a boundary being set, which validates the strength of feeling behind it.
- Slightly More Expressive or Dramatic (Within Reason): Intermediate responses may include a performative element or more dramatic wording than beginner ones, yet still feel genuine. For instance, a therapist responding to “I shut down when I can’t get a word in” said: “Yes, it is as if you just fold up like an accordion… kind of like ‘What is the point, why bother?’” ￼. The therapist even physically pantomimed folding up (noted in the transcript), and added a sighed phrase (“why bother?”) to emphasize despair. This dramatization stays true to the client’s experience of defeat, making it almost tangible. Such expressive touches – a metaphor of an accordion closing, a weary inner voice – show deeper attunement and are appropriate as the therapist grows more confident.
- Maintains Clarity and Client-Centeredness: Despite richer imagery, the response should still be phrased clearly and in a way the client can easily grasp. The therapist avoids obscure or overly elaborate metaphors. They often reuse the client’s key words or themes so the connection is obvious. For example, another intermediate response: “Somehow it feels like the most perfect relationship. It’s as if there are no boundaries, no walls to bump up against.” ￼, given to a client describing a too-perfect, boundless relationship. The therapist here echoes “perfect” and introduces the image of “no walls,” which artfully conveys both the allure and the potential problem (nothing to “bump up against” can actually feel unsettling). The language is simple (“no walls”), yet it elegantly captures a complex feeling. The client hearing this would likely sense that the therapist truly “gets” the strange mix of comfort and discomfort in that scenario.
- Adapted to the Level of Challenge: These responses show the trainee how to step up their empathic skill: being a bit more daring with language and layering meaning, while still grounding everything in the client’s narrative. The intermediate therapist response models that one can be imaginative (even slightly poetic or metaphorical) without losing the client. In practice, trainees learn to find those poignant images or phrases that encapsulate what the client is living, and deliver them in a confident, compassionate manner. The result should be that the client feels even more understood than before, as the therapist has articulated the unspoken emotional truth in a concise, evocative way.

## Advanced Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Advanced)

Advanced-level client statements that prompt empathic evocation are typically intense, complex, and sometimes guarded or indirect. These markers often involve high-stakes emotional content or defensive coping that the therapist must sensitively respond to with powerful empathy. Characteristics of high-quality advanced markers include:
- Emotionally Charged Content: The client discloses or alludes to very strong feelings or experiences – e.g. despair, trauma, profound shame, or extreme fear of betrayal. The emotional stakes are high. For example, one advanced client says calmly, “Everything is perfect… Maybe we should stop therapy?” even though just a week prior they “felt suicidal” when their girlfriend left ￼. This marker carries life-and-death emotional weight (suicidal despair) hidden behind a facade of “I’m fine now,” which is ripe for empathic intervention. Another advanced statement is “…deep inside there is really something wrong with me, like I am rotten to the core.” ￼ – here the client directly voices a metaphor of fundamental defectiveness, indicating deep shame. Such content is intense and requires the therapist to meet it with equal emotional intensity in their response.
- Defensiveness or Denial: High-level markers often include some form of defense, intellectualization, or challenge. The client might be holding back or only hinting at their true feelings. For instance, a client with a tough exterior might repeat a parental message: “My father taught me that only weak people have feelings.” ￼ – a belief that suppresses vulnerability. Or a distrustful client might threaten the therapist: “If you betray me, I’ll report you…” ￼, which on the surface is anger, but underneath may be deep hurt. These statements are authentic (clients at advanced stages often test therapists or shield themselves) and they naturally call for the therapist to look beyond the surface. A high-quality marker provides enough of a clue (a charged phrase like “rotten to the core” or an extreme stance like “only weak people feel”) that a skilled therapist can infer the pain or fear beneath and respond to that.
- Use of Metaphor or Symbol by the Client: Interestingly, advanced clients themselves sometimes use metaphoric language or dramatic expressions, though often in a negative way about themselves. For example, “rotten to the core” is the client’s own metaphor for their perceived defectiveness ￼. Another might say “I’m in such a tangled, confused place” or describe an overwhelming feeling of being stuck. These self-descriptions provide “fertile ground” for the therapist to extend the metaphor (e.g., tangled, stuck, lost) and show deep understanding. High-quality advanced markers often have these rich phrases embedded or heavy implications that beg for a strong empathic illustration in response.
- Multiple Layers of Feeling: Advanced statements can be layered – the client may state something cognitive or factual that masks an emotion. For instance, “I don’t even know what I feel or where to begin” ￼ expresses confusion and overwhelm; or the earlier example of sudden cheeriness after suicidal ideation expresses denial and likely fear. There may also be mixed emotions (e.g., love and hate, relief and shame, etc.) in one narrative. A high-quality marker doesn’t spell all that out, but it contains it for the therapist to unpack. The complexity makes it appropriate for advanced training: the therapist must discern the poignant element to focus on.
- Plausibility and Depth: Even at their most intense, these markers remain believable (therapists do encounter clients who say such things). They feel heavy when you hear them. The client might say it in a flat or offhand tone (which itself is a defense), or they might be visibly distressed. Either way, the depth is apparent. The best markers at this level touch on themes like life meaning, trust vs. betrayal, identity (“something wrong with me”), mortality, etc. – core existential or relational wounds that truly test a therapist’s capacity for empathic attunement.

Example (Advanced Marker): “I feel like nobody really knows I feel this, but deep inside there is really something wrong with me, like I am rotten to the core.” ￼ – This is a quintessential advanced-level client statement. The client openly shares a belief of personal defectiveness (a severe shame-based feeling). The phrase “rotten to the core” is visceral and imaginative, signaling how pervasive and entrenched this feeling is. It’s emotionally resonant and gives a clear image of the client’s pain for the therapist to work with. A therapist can’t just say “you feel really bad about yourself” and do it justice – this marker demands an equally powerful empathic evocation (as we’ll see below). It’s also realistic; clients dealing with deep shame or trauma often feel exactly this type of “core” badness. The marker’s complexity lies in its intensity and metaphorical richness, which is fitting for an advanced exercise.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Advanced)

Advanced empathic evocation responses are the most creative, nuanced, and powerful demonstrations of this skill. The therapist meets the client’s intense or defended emotion with an equally strong, multi-layered empathy, often using bold metaphors that resonate on a gut level. Characteristics of high-quality advanced responses include:
- Rich, Multi-Layered Metaphors: Therapists at this level often employ extended metaphors or multiple images in one response to fully capture the client’s complex emotional state. The language can be almost poetic, yet it remains authentic to the client’s experience. For example, in response to the client who insisted “everything is perfect” after a suicidal episode, the therapist said: “When things feel okay, it feels like you have been able to stop the bleeding, but I guess the wounds underneath run really deep.” ￼. This response acknowledges the client’s claim of feeling better (“stop the bleeding”) but then delivers the deeper truth with a vivid injury metaphor (“wounds run really deep”). In one sentence, it uses a medical/emergency image to convey that although the surface looks healed, serious pain persists underneath. Such a response is powerfully empathic because it doesn’t confront the client’s denial head-on with logic, but rather paints a picture that validates both their relief and their hidden hurt.
- Alignment with Client’s Imagery or Themes: High-quality responses build on any metaphor the client offered or create one that perfectly fits the client’s narrative. A standout example: for the client who felt “rotten to the core,” the therapist responded, “It is as if you have this beautiful linen cloth, but somehow there is a dark stain spreading across it, and try as you might, you cannot get rid of it, you cannot purify it.” ￼. Here the therapist doesn’t use the word “rotten” directly; instead they craft a fresh metaphor (a spreading dark stain on a pure fabric) to symbolize the client’s shame. This image is novel and poignant – it conveys contamination, stubborn permanence, and contrast between pure vs. stained. It resonates emotionally (one can almost feel the anguish of trying to clean the stain and failing) and elegantly captures what “rotten to the core” feels like. The therapist’s language “try as you might, you cannot get rid of it” shows deep empathy for how hard the client has tried to feel “clean” or good, and “cannot purify it” ties directly into the moral aspect of shame. Advanced evocations often have this level of imaginative alignment with the client’s inner world.
- Explicitly Acknowledges Depth and Severity: Whereas a beginner response might say “very hurt” or “so angry,” an advanced response doesn’t shy away from emphasizing how deep or serious the feeling is. Words like “really deep,” “tangled,” “stuck,” “cuts deep,” “bleeding,” “wound,” “dark,” etc., are common. For example, to a client who is intensely distrustful due to past betrayals, a therapist might say, “It sounds like you have been really hurt before, and the wound of betrayal cuts really deep.” ￼. This response plainly uses the “wound” metaphor and the phrase “cuts really deep” to validate the magnitude of the client’s pain. It is straightforward yet powerful – much more impactful than a mild reflection like “you’ve been hurt a lot before.” In advanced responses, the therapist often names the pain in a strong way (while still using metaphor or imagery), which shows the client that their suffering is truly understood in full.
- Multi-Sensory or Layered Imagery: Advanced evocations may engage more than one sense or image to depict a complex state. For a client who said they are confused and don’t know where to begin, the therapist layered two images: “So, just tangled up as if you are stuck in the mud… not even knowing what door to open next.” ￼. In this, “tangled up” evokes a visual of knotted threads or vines (entrapment and chaos), “stuck in the mud” evokes a tactile sensation of heaviness and immobilization, and “not knowing what door to open” evokes an image of many choices (cognitive confusion). By stringing these together, the therapist encapsulated the client’s emotional state of confusion, paralysis, and uncertainty in a way a single image might not. This multi-layer approach is advanced because it risks being over-complex, but when done well, it powerfully mirrors a multifaceted experience. It tells the client: every aspect of your overwhelm is seen – the emotional tangle, the feeling of heaviness, the lost sense of direction.
- Creative Yet Grounded: Creativity in advanced responses is only effective if it’s grounded in the client’s reality. High-quality responses avoid clichés and are tailored to the specific client. Therapists often come up with metaphors that are a bit fresh or unexpected, which can jolt the client into recognizing “Yes, that’s exactly it.” However, they ensure the metaphor is understandable and fitting. The use of a “strict officer in your head” for the macho client with the army father, or an imagined voice “ringing in your ears… ‘only weak people feel…’” ￼, aligns with that client’s background and internal struggle. It’s creative (not a stock phrase) but totally fitting (father’s voice as an internalized drill sergeant). This level of personalization in the imagery makes the empathy hit home.
- Tone of Profound Empathy: The delivery of advanced responses, though not captured in text, would typically be slower, softer, or more grave if the situation calls for it. The therapist might pause for effect, use gentle emphasis on key words (“really deep… cannot purify it”), or even allow their own genuine emotion to filter into their voice. The language does a lot of the work in advanced responses, but how it is said matters too – it should convey that the therapist is genuinely moved by the client’s experience. In writing training examples, this is hard to show, but the richness of the words implies a matching tone. Trainees can infer that advanced empathic evocation is not just about fancy metaphors; it’s about truly daring to feel with the client and articulate the pain or fear that the client themselves have difficulty expressing.

In summary, advanced therapist responses are bold, compassionate, and intricately attuned to the client’s profound emotional wounds or defenses. They model to trainees that when a client is in deep pain (or hiding pain behind defenses), a therapist can respond not with simple platitudes, but with striking imagery and heartfelt depth. This helps break through the client’s emotional walls – the client hears not just that the therapist understands, but almost that the therapist can see into the heart of their experience and is not afraid to go there with them. Such responses, when accurate, often lead the client to feel deeply validated and may even evoke a significant emotional reaction (tears of relief, etc.), which is the therapeutic aim of empathic evocation at its best.

Using These Guidelines: By examining high-quality markers and responses at each level, one can generate new client statements and therapist replies that are appropriate for training in empathic evocation. Remember that client markers should be emotionally authentic, resonate with real client voices, contain some imagery or “hook,” and match the complexity of the level. Therapist responses should demonstrate the skill clearly, using evocative language (metaphors, similes, sensory descriptions) to deepen the client’s emotion, while remaining natural, empathetic, and proportionate to the client’s statement. At the beginner stage the focus is on simple, clear evocations of one feeling; at intermediate, on capturing nuance and layering imagery a bit; at advanced, on truly creative and powerful metaphors that meet the client’s intense emotions. By following these principles, trainees and educators can create varied and high-quality practice scenarios that truly enhance empathic skills in EFT, ensuring the evocation technique is learned in a way that’s both effective and true to real therapy conversations.
