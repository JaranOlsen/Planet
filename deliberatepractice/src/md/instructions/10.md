# Self-Disclosure Skill in EFT: Client Markers and Therapist Responses

Self-disclosure in emotion-focused therapy is when the therapist briefly shares a personal feeling, reaction, or fact to strengthen the alliance and normalize the client’s experience ￼ ￼. High-quality practice markers (client statements) are those that naturally invite such sharing, and high-quality therapist responses demonstrate it clearly and empathetically. Below we describe what these look like at each difficulty level.

## Beginner Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Beginner)

Beginner markers are simple, direct expressions that clearly invite therapist openness ￼. They often come as straightforward questions or tentative admissions in plain, everyday language. For example, a client might simply ask, “Are you married?” ￼ or say “I feel so vulnerable and alone… you must think I’m crazy, right?” ￼. Such statements focus on one clear issue (personal status, basic reassurance) and contain minimal complexity or mixed emotion. Key traits include:
- Direct questions or statements: The client explicitly seeks information or reassurance (e.g. “So should I just start anywhere?” ￼).
- Basic personal concerns or judgments: Simple curiosity or self-doubt (“Are you married?”, “I’m such a mess – you must think I’m crazy, right?” ￼).
- Plain, natural language: The phrasing sounds like real speech (with hesitations or context), not technical jargon. For example, “I just moved here… can you help me?” would fit this level.
- Single-focused emotion or question: Only one dominant feeling or concern is expressed, making the marker easy to interpret and respond to.

These markers are “believable first-session” comments that overtly cue the therapist to speak about themselves or their feelings ￼.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Beginner)

At the beginner level, therapists respond briefly and honestly, directly answering the client’s query and then refocusing on the client ￼. The tone is warm, supportive, and genuine. Key features are:
- Concise disclosure: The therapist shares a small personal fact or feeling (using “I” statements) sufficient to address the client’s concern, then returns attention to the client. For example, answering “So should I just start anywhere?” with “I am very excited to begin our work together…” satisfies the client’s anxiety and sets a welcoming tone ￼.
- Answer then redirect: If a client asks a personal question (e.g. “Are you married?”), a high-quality response is “Yes, I am married and have two children. I’m curious what that means for you.” ￼.  The therapist honestly answers and immediately asks the client to reflect, keeping the focus on the client’s feelings or assumptions.
- Reassurance of positive regard: When a client fears judgment (“You must think I’m crazy”), the therapist explicitly counters it: “I do not see you as crazy at all. I actually feel a lot of concern and empathy for you.” ￼. This corrects the client’s misperception in a caring, confident tone.
- Brevity and relevance: Disclosures are minimal and relevant (no irrelevant details). For instance, if disclosing marital status, the therapist states only the fact (married/unmarried) without excess description ￼.
- Warmth and genuineness: The language is conversational and empathetic (e.g. “I feel moved to hear you share this with me.” ￼). The therapist models being “real” but not self-focused.

In sum, beginner responses clearly satisfy the client’s request (fact or feeling) in a single “I” statement, then gently invite the client’s perspective ￼ ￼. This builds trust and models appropriate therapist honesty.

## Intermediate Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Intermediate)

Intermediate markers are more nuanced and challenging, reflecting the client’s reactions to the therapy process or therapist. They often involve process discomfort or subtle critiques ￼. Examples include a client noticing the therapist’s nonverbal behavior or expressing unease: “I’ve seen you yawn a few times today. Am I boring you?” ￼ or “Just being here makes me really uncomfortable.” ￼. Other markers might express a worry indirectly (e.g. “I think you get bored listening to my problems… Is that true?” ￼). Key traits are:
- Observation of therapist/process: The client references something they notice (yawning, a glum expression, silence) and asks what it means.
- Expressions of discomfort or skepticism: The client may state feeling uneasy with therapy, or question if the therapist is bored or resentful (e.g. “Is this making you uncomfortable?”).
- Hints of underlying feelings: Even statements not directly asking for disclosure (like deep sadness) can serve as cues if sharing something meaningful (e.g. describing grief may invite a similar self-disclosure of empathy).
- Natural emotional complexity: These markers may carry mixed emotions or subtext. For instance, asking “Am I boring you?” expresses anxiety and self-consciousness simultaneously.
- Invitation for honesty: The client essentially wants to test the therapist’s genuineness (without accusing bluntly), providing space for more personal therapist response.

These statements still sound like real client speech – complete with honest voice and details – but they go beyond first-session pleasantries into the real work of the relationship ￼.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Intermediate)

Intermediate responses involve balanced candor and empathy. The therapist acknowledges the client’s concern and honestly discloses a small personal reaction or feeling, but always remains supportive and focused on the client ￼ ￼. For example, in response to “Am I boring you?”, an effective reply is:
- “Oh, I am really sorry. I am a bit tired today, but it does not reflect how I feel about you or what you’re saying.” ￼

Here the therapist apologizes for any discomfort and admits “I am a bit tired” – a humanizing truth – then immediately reassures the client that the problem lies with the therapist’s fatigue, not the client. This alleviates the client’s worry. Other response qualities include:
- Acknowledging and validating: The therapist often starts with empathy (“I’m sorry you feel uncomfortable…” ￼) or praise for honesty.
- Brief personal truth: Admitting an ordinary trait or state (“I was a bit distracted,” “I sometimes feel we’re stuck”) ￼ ￼. The truth is simple and client-centered (not over-sharing).
- Reassurance of intentions: Clarify that the client is not to blame (e.g. “It’s not because of you; I do value what you’re saying.”).
- Empathic feeling-sharing: The therapist may share an emotional resonance (e.g. “As you tell me about your dog, I feel so sad, moved to tears” ￼). This shows genuine care without detracting from the client’s story.
- Collaborative tone: If there’s a problem (like feeling “stuck” in therapy), the therapist frames it as mutual (“we are a little stuck”) and invites joint work (“Let’s work together to deepen our sessions.” ￼).

Throughout, the therapist language remains polite, genuine, and not defensive. They may correct misperceptions quickly (“I am not bored at all”) and emphasize their commitment to the client ￼. In essence, intermediate responses model authentic openness: truthful enough to build trust, but always steering back to support the client’s process.

## Advanced Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Advanced)

Advanced markers are intense, complex, and boundary-testing. They often include strong emotions or confront the therapist directly. Examples are a client repeatedly late and casual (“Hi… I know I’m late again. Where should we start?” ￼), personal or flirtatious comments (“I’ve been feeling attracted to you… do you ever think about me that way?” ￼), or harsh critiques (“I hate it when you get that look of pity in your eyes.” ￼). These statements typically carry multiple emotions (anger with hurt, desire with anxiety, hopelessness with suspicion) and push for a reaction. High-quality advanced markers:
- Test boundaries or express transference: Frequent rule-violations or intimate statements that probe therapist limits (lateness, flirting, overt neediness).
- Direct confrontation or deep vulnerability: Accusations of therapist’s attitude (“You look down on me”), challenges to the therapist’s competence (“How do I know you can help me?” ￼), or revealing painful fantasies (suicidal thoughts, etc.).
- Layered emotions: The client may flip between anger, hurt, fear, and longing in one statement, indicating intense inner conflict.
- Pressure for genuine response: These markers imply, “show me you care/honestly,” putting the therapist in a delicate spot.

These statements are still phrased naturally – often emotionally charged – but signal that simple reassurance won’t suffice. They demand a skilled, personal reply.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Advanced)

Advanced responses are brave, honest, and compassionate. The therapist must clearly articulate their own reactions (feelings or thoughts) in a way that maintains respect and invites dialogue. For example:
- Naming genuine feelings: In response to repeated lateness, a therapist might say “It’s hard for me to tell you this, but when you come late I actually feel annoyed and kind of diminished inside.” ￼. This is a truthful I statement about the therapist’s internal reaction.
- Correcting perceptions gently: To a remark about pity, the therapist could say “Thank you for telling me how you feel. Actually, I do not feel pity; I feel moved and concerned for you.” ￼. The therapist acknowledges the client’s emotional charge and then clarifies the true empathy behind their expression.
- Honest factual disclosure: If challenged on experience, the therapist might respond “I do understand your concern. I have three months of experience, and I really want to help you. Perhaps we can explore what you are looking for in therapy.” ￼. This admits limitations without defensiveness and refocuses on the client’s needs.
- Warm respect and openness: Advanced responses often begin with gratitude for the client’s honesty (“Wow, it must have been hard to ask me that” ￼), and use a steady, empathetic tone even while delivering hard truths.
- Inviting reflection: The therapist frequently ends disclosures with a question or pause (e.g. “What do you feel when you hear me say that?” ￼), to involve the client in processing the disclosure.

In bullets, advanced therapist response traits include:
- Transparent feelings (“I feel X when Y” ￼).
- Calmly correcting misunderstandings (“I do not feel pity; I feel concerned” ￼).
- Balancing honesty with empathy: State a truth or limit while reaffirming care.
- Maintaining client focus: Even deep disclosures are brief and followed by returning the spotlight (often via a question or gentle invitation).

These responses model professional vulnerability: the therapist shows they, too, have emotions and imperfections, but use them constructively. They neither overreact nor withdraw. By doing so, they teach the client that honest emotional exchanges are safe and valued in therapy ￼ ￼.
