# Exercise 4: Exploratory Questions – High-Quality Markers and Responses

## Overview

Exploratory questions in EFT are open-ended, curiosity-driven questions that invite clients to delve into their present emotional experience. They focus on the here-and-now – asking about feelings, bodily sensations, images, meanings or needs that arise as the client talks.  For example, a good EFT question might be, “What are you feeling inside your body right now?” – a prompt that shifts attention to the client’s somatic experience and helps bypass intellectual defenses ￼.  A high-quality client marker is a realistic, emotional statement that naturally invites this kind of question; a high-quality therapist response is a nonjudgmental, open-ended question (often grounded in body awareness) that encourages further exploration.  Below we detail the hallmarks of strong markers and responses at the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of difficulty.

## Beginner Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Beginner)

- Simple, explicit feelings: The client says exactly what they feel in a clear way.  For example: “When she glared at me, I felt so little inside,” or “He hung up on me and I was just really hurt.”  A single, straightforward emotion is expressed (anger, shame, sadness, etc.), making it obvious what to explore.
- Vivid sensory or bodily language: The statement uses concrete, sensory words or metaphors.  Phrases like “makes my blood boil” or “felt so small” tie the emotion to a physical image.  This vivid wording naturally invites questions about what the feeling is like in the body (e.g. “Where is that in your body right now?”).
- Everyday, believable context: The situation is realistic and relatable (arguments with a family member, workplace stress, etc.) so the emotion makes sense.  For example, “My son’s new girlfriend was so rude to me, I couldn’t believe how angry I felt.”  Such normal scenarios help the therapist ask questions as if following a real conversation.
- Implicit vulnerability or curiosity: Even if not stated outright, the client’s tone may hint that they’re a bit confused or upset by feeling this way (“I guess I shouldn’t feel this angry…”).  This suggests they’re open to understanding more.  A marker like “I was really taken advantage of, so used” silently raises questions (“Used by whom? What happened inside?”) that the therapist can explore.
- Variety of basic emotions: Across different markers, there is a range of feelings (joy, worry, fear, etc.) in simple form.  One client might say, “I feel really alone,” while another says, “I’m so frustrated with him.”  This variety ensures practice covers different emotions.  (All markers at this level stay fairly direct and single-focused so beginner therapists can clearly hear one feeling to explore.)

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Beginner)

- Reflects the feeling and asks about it: The therapist first names or mirrors the feeling, then gently invites more detail.  For example: “Yes, you felt so small when she glared at you… Can you close your eyes for a moment and notice what that feels like in your body right now?”  This kind of response acknowledges the client (“Yes, you felt…”) and then asks an open question about their inner experience.
- Invites bodily awareness: Most beginner questions point to the body or inner experience.  The therapist might say, “Where in your body do you feel that hurt?” or “What is that feeling like in your chest or stomach?”  By focusing on physical sensation (“inside your body”), the question helps the client connect an emotion to a concrete feeling.  Often the therapist suggests a simple action like putting a hand on the place (“See if you can put your hand there and describe it”), which beginners can do.
- Uses present-oriented, simple phrasing: Questions use words like “here,” “right now,” “inside you.” They keep grammar short and gentle.  For instance, instead of “Why did you feel that way?” the therapist asks, “What do you imagine happening inside you when you felt so used?”  This phrasing is easy to understand and shifts focus to the client’s immediate experience.
- Warm, inviting tone: The therapist’s tone is soft and curious, never harsh or puzzled. They speak slowly, with empathy.  For example, the therapist might lean forward, make eye contact, and say in a caring voice, “I’m so sorry you went through that. You really felt alone… What is that feeling like, right now?”  This kind of compassionate manner makes the client feel safe to explore more.  For example, the therapist might ask in a gentle, steady tone: “Yes…so you felt really alone. Can you notice where in your body that loneliness shows up? Put a hand there and tell me about it.”
- Encourages expression without pressure: The questions are inviting but not forcing.  The therapist might use pauses or encouraging sounds (“mm-hmm,” “tell me more”) to show patience.  Sometimes they invite a small enactment: e.g. “Can you imagine her sitting here and say, ‘I felt so hurt when you did that’?” This kind of question is still simple but opens a little action. Overall, beginner responses are caring and steady, keeping the client focused on exploring the feeling rather than analyzing it.

## Intermediate Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Intermediate)

- Stronger or mixed emotions: The client’s statement has more intensity or layers than the beginner level.  For example: “I feel so worthless — like I have nothing to offer,” or “He cheated on me again this weekend. I’m furious, but I can’t stop loving him.”  These express deep pain or conflict.  They may combine two emotions (anger and sadness, love and betrayal) in one statement. This complexity signals the therapist to explore beneath the surface.
- Inner conflict and ambivalence: Intermediate markers often show the client torn between feelings or beliefs.  Example: “I’ve always fallen for the wrong guys… I’m excited about this new relationship, but I’m also really scared I’ll make the same mistakes.”  Here, excitement and fear are mixed.  A good marker captures both sides. This invites a question like, “Tell me more about feeling excited and scared at the same time.”
- Hurtful self-talk or shame cues: Many statements include negative self-judgment or shame, which begs gentle questioning.  For instance, “I guess I’m just never good enough” or “I feel disgusting about what I did.”  Such language implicitly asks, “Why do I feel this way?” or “What does this say about me?” The therapist can respond with curiosity rather than letting it pass.
- Underlying needs or voids: The client may hint at something missing in their life.  For example: “I cannot stop thinking about him… like I have this empty space inside that only he filled.”  Or: “My dad is gone, and I still feel all this anger… I think there was something missing between us.”  These cues about a “void” or “missing piece” are prime opportunities for the therapist to ask, “What do you feel you need that might be missing?”
- Somatic or metaphorical detail: Intermediate markers often mention body feelings or use vivid images.  For example, “It leaves me with this churning, empty feeling in my stomach,” or “It’s like my heart just shuts down.”  The client has begun to notice their physiology or use metaphor. This gives the therapist something concrete to ask about (e.g. “What does that churning feel like?”).

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Intermediate)

- Probes underlying needs/meanings: The therapist asks questions that draw out the deeper significance of the feeling.  Examples: “What do you feel you are getting from this relationship that makes it so hard to give up?” or “When you say it feels like a void, what do you think you were missing?” Such questions invite the client to reflect on what the emotion is connected to (needs, hopes, fears).
- Continues bodily exploration with detail: The therapist keeps focusing on sensations but at a more detailed level. For instance, “You said it was empty and churning in your stomach… can you put your hand there? What do you notice under your hand right now? What is that feeling trying to tell you?”  These questions guide the client to articulate exactly what happens in the body as they speak.
- Acknowledges and then questions: Intermediate responses often acknowledge the struggle and then follow with a question. For example: “I can see this is so hard for you. You really care about him even though he hurt you… What do you think that love is doing for you right now?”  The therapist validates (“so hard for you… you care”) and then gently inquires. This balances empathy with curiosity.
- Invites process and pacing: The therapist may encourage the client to show or explain a process. For example: “You mentioned you just shut down. Let’s try to notice how you do that. What happens in your body when you shut down? Where do you feel that?”  This turns a metaphor (“shutting down”) into an exploration of actual sensation.
- Keeps questions open and client-centered: All questions remain open (“what,” “how,” “where” not “why”), and always about the client’s experience.  The therapist avoids yes/no prompts or interpretations at this stage. For example: “What do you notice in yourself as you describe this?” or “Can you say more about that feeling of being left out?”  This style helps the client stay focused on describing their own internal world.

## Advanced Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Advanced)

- Profound, multi-layered emotion: The client expresses very intense feelings, often tied to serious issues (trauma, long-term loss, existential despair).  For example: “After 25 years together, I can’t believe she just walked away… I feel utterly devastated and betrayed.”  The emotion is deep and real (e.g. rage and heartbreak together). Such statements are heavy with feeling, signaling the need for a careful, deep question.
- Complex inner conflict: Advanced markers often reveal contradictions or clashes between feelings and beliefs.  Example: “My father abused me and I’m so angry at him, but I was raised that I must always honor my parents… I feel ashamed to even feel this way.”  Here the client has anger and shame that conflict with cultural or moral rules.  A high-quality marker lets the therapist know to ask about both sides.
- Taboo or highly vulnerable content: The client says something very personal or “dangerous,” like suicidal thoughts, dark fantasies, or unexpected feelings (“I almost wished I would die to get attention” or “I feel love for my therapist and I’m scared to say it”).  These admissions are rare and sensitive. They implicitly ask, “Is it okay to feel this?” and invite exploration of what it means.
- Identity and self-judgment issues: Statements might touch on core identity or worth.  For example: “I feel rotten to the core — like something is terribly wrong with me inside.”  Or cultural identity cues (e.g. “As a man, I’m not supposed to cry… but I feel so sad”).  These markers mix emotion with deep self-critique or identity roles, opening a door for questions about self and values.
- Mind-body confusion or overwhelm: The client may admit being overwhelmed or unable to articulate feelings: “I’m in such a confused place right now, I don’t even know what I feel.”  This says the client is ready for help putting feelings into words. A good marker of this kind indicates the therapist can safely guide the client in exploration (e.g. focusing on any faint sensation to begin).

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Advanced)

- Focuses on bodily/emotional cues in-the-moment: The therapist invites the client to stay with and describe their immediate experience, often pointing to physical signals.  For example: “I notice tears falling… see if you can talk from those tears. What are they telling you?” ￼.  Or “Your body is shaking as you say this… what is that trying to express?”  These questions help the client access raw emotion as it is happening.- Attention to moment-to-moment experience: The therapist might say, “As those tears begin to fall… what do the tears say? I am so sad, I miss her,” encouraging the client to speak from the crying. This anchors the question in present feeling.
- Validates all facets and conflict: The therapist calmly names each strong emotion or side of a conflict the client expressed.  For example: “It sounds like you feel very deep anger and deep shame about what happened.” They then normalize this clash: “Of course you feel angry — you went through terrible abuse — and of course you feel ashamed, because you were taught to honor him. It’s a really hard place to be.” By doing this, the questioner shows the client that all parts of their experience are heard and make sense.
- Evocative empathy and meaning-making: The therapist uses rich, compassionate language to mirror the intensity. For example: “Wow, that must have felt absolutely terrifying. You were so scared and in such pain… I hear a longing to be seen and loved under all that despair.” Sometimes the question is embedded: “You were longing for her attention — when you wish you would die so she’d notice, what does that say about what you need?” These kinds of responses (often phrased as questions) connect the feeling to its deeper need in an emotionally vivid way.
- Invites deeper reflection with advanced questions: Even with intense material, the therapist keeps questions open-ended but may layer them carefully. For example: “What happens inside as you look at me and say you feel rotten inside?” or “If the anger and sadness could speak, what would each one say right now?”  These advanced questions prompt the client to personify or articulate hidden aspects of their feeling.
- Steady, compassionate presence: Throughout, the therapist remains grounded and nonjudgmental. They use pauses and gentle cues (like “mmm…” or a nod) to allow silence. Even when asking complex questions, they speak slowly and clearly. This calm steadiness (often paired with strong empathy) gives the client a sense of safety to stay in the intense emotion. The overall effect is that the client feels truly understood, making it possible to explore the pain without shutting down.
