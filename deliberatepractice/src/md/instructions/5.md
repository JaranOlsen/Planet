# Providing Treatment Rationale for Emotion-Focused Therapy – High-Quality Markers and Responses

## Beginner Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Beginner)

- Curious, open questions about therapy/EFT: For example, a client might ask “How does therapy work?” or “Why does talking about my feelings help me feel better?” ￼. These markers are straightforward and friendly, showing genuine uncertainty or hope (e.g. “Can you tell me more about your approach to therapy?” ￼). The tone is neutral or mildly anxious rather than hostile.
- Logistical or process questions: Clients may express basic confusion about the process, such as “I’ve never been in therapy… What do we talk about here?” ￼ or “Should I tell you about my history?” ￼. These statements are credible for a newcomer and invite the therapist to explain how an EFT session unfolds (e.g. focusing on present feelings). The language is everyday and open-ended, giving the therapist a clear opening to provide a simple rationale.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Beginner)

- Simple, reassuring orientation: The therapist responds in clear, friendly language that orients the client to EFT. For example: “Of course. In our sessions we are going to explore your emotions together, discuss how you feel about things, solve problems, and help you decide on the best course of action for you” ￼. This answer avoids jargon and covers key points (“explore your emotions,” “solve problems,” “best course of action”) in plain terms. It starts warmly (“Of course”) and gives the client a sense of structure and support.
- Link feelings to needs: The response explains the purpose of focusing on emotions. For instance: “Talking about your feelings can help you understand what you feel so that you can better identify what you need” ￼. This statement is concise and positive: it acknowledges the question (“can help you”) and outlines a simple rationale (feelings → understanding → needs) that a beginner client can grasp.
- Highlight client choice and control: The therapist emphasizes that the client guides the session. For example: “I like to let you decide what you want to focus on. Maybe you could take a moment, check inside, and see what feels most pressing at the moment?” ￼. This invites the client to check in with their feelings (“check inside”) and choose the topic, modeling an EFT principle while empowering the client.
- Warm, non-technical tone: All beginner responses use everyday words (explore, feel, help) and a confident, caring tone ￼ ￼. The therapist might normalize the question (e.g. “That’s a very common question”) and emphasize benefits (“this approach will help you feel better or meet your needs”). The key is being clear and positive, reducing anxiety by answering “what” and “why” without overwhelming detail.

## Intermediate Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Intermediate)

- Expressed doubts or misconceptions: Clients voice mild skepticism or worry about the emotional focus. Examples include “I’m not sure I understand how talking about my feelings will help” and “If I talk about feeling sad or angry, couldn’t I just feel worse?” ￼. These are believable concerns from someone somewhat engaged but unsure. The language may include negative words like “worried” or “worst,” and the tone is respectful but hesitant.
- Labeling feelings as problematic: Statements like “I think my feelings are irrational. Won’t talking about them make it worse?” ￼ show the client questioning the usefulness of their emotions. This implies a cognitive distortion that therapy will need to reframe.
- Comparing to others/idealizing: For example, “My friends on Facebook are always happy and positive. I want to be like that. Can you help me?” ￼. The client expresses a hope (to be happy) and an implicit worry (that their sadness is wrong), opening a chance to explain how genuine satisfaction comes from acknowledging difficult feelings.
- Shame or fear about showing feelings: A marker like “I’m embarrassed of how sad I feel all the time… I think I look ugly when I cry” ￼ reveals vulnerability. The client is worried about crying uncontrollably or appearing weak. This realistic, layered statement (shame + fear of overwhelm) invites the therapist to reassure and normalize emotional expression.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Intermediate)

- Validate and educate: The therapist first normalizes the concern and then gives a clear explanation. For example: “This is a very common concern, and I appreciate you sharing it. You see, at their core, feelings give us important information, and when we’re comfortable experiencing and expressing feelings, we are usually more able to meet our needs” ￼. This response praises the client for voicing doubt (“very common concern”), thanks them, and then explains simply that feelings carry important information and help in meeting needs.
- Honest, balanced reassurance: The therapist acknowledges that working with feelings can feel hard but emphasizes its benefits. For instance: “Sometimes talking about difficult feelings can make you feel temporarily worse, although sometimes it actually makes you feel better. Overall, it is helpful to share your feelings with someone, so you feel less isolated and alone with those feelings” ￼. This admits the truth (it can feel worse at first) but highlights the payoff (feeling less alone). The tone is caring and realistic, never dismissive.
- Reframe irrational feelings: The response gently corrects the idea that feelings are “nonsense.” Example: “I know it sometimes feels like our feelings don’t make sense, but actually there is often a lot of sense in your feelings. By giving your inner world a voice, we can work together to try to figure out which feelings you want to listen to and which ones are not helping you… those are the feelings we want to help transform” ￼. This validates (“I know it feels like that”) and then redefines (“there is sense in your feelings”). It introduces the idea of discerning between helpful and unhelpful feelings (“transform feelings”), in a collaborative tone.
- Normalize emotional expression: The therapist explicitly reassures about showing feelings. For example: “That sounds like a difficult experience… You somehow feel like your sadness and tears are ugly. I actually think they are so important—and important to listen to. After all, therapy is a place that you can cry, and I imagine this is some of what we will do here together” ￼. Here, the therapist acknowledges the shame (“your tears are ugly”), counters it with validation (“they are important”), and states that crying is acceptable in therapy (“place that you can cry”). The tone is warm and empathetic, turning the client’s shame into permission and hope.

## Advanced Level

### High-Quality Client Markers (Advanced)

- Direct skepticism or rejection: Clients may challenge the core premise of EFT. For example, “I don’t think this is going to work for me because my emotions are part of the problem. That’s what I want you to help me with, to feel less!” ￼. This marker flatly rejects the idea of exploring emotions, demanding that the therapist help them feel less emotion. It’s plausible for someone equating emotions with pain.
- Demanding guarantees and expressing trauma: For instance: “How can you guarantee that if I go into my painful emotions, I am going to feel better afterward? … My experience has been that I go in there and just feel worse. How will this be different?” ￼. This is a sophisticated challenge from a client who has tried therapy before. It includes a demand for certainty (“guarantee”) and references real past hurt (“get lost and feel worse”), requiring the therapist to address both logic and emotion.
- Trust and safety concerns: A client with past trauma may say, “I’ve had bad experiences in therapy before… How can I know that I am safe with you?” ￼. This heartfelt doubt about safety forces the therapist to justify not just what the therapy is, but how it will be a secure process.
- Worldview about control and strength: For example, “I hate that I can’t control my feelings. I believe this makes me weak. I want to control my feelings, so I can be strong. Can you help me with this?” ￼. The client equates emotional control with strength and is essentially asking to suppress feelings. This contradicts EFT principles and thus demands a nuanced rationale.
- Fear about specific emotions: e.g. “My doctor said I have an anger problem… Is it safe for me to explore my feelings? Shouldn’t I just try to get rid of my anger?” ￼. This marker shows the client’s worry that exploring anger will be dangerous. It’s delivered in a frank, worried tone (fear of losing control), pushing the therapist to explain how and why working with anger can be safe and helpful.

### High-Quality Therapist Responses (Advanced)

- Empathetic explanation with examples: The therapist combines understanding with a clear rationale. For example: “I understand your experience tells you that emotions can sometimes feel dangerous or disorganizing. Here we are going to explore your feelings, but in some new ways you might not have done before. This is important as it will give us a sense of what is missing for you and what you need. Remember that I will be on this journey with you” ￼. This response first acknowledges (“I understand… feels dangerous”), then reframes (“we will explore them in a new way”) and points to purpose (“to see what is missing”). It ends with reassurance (“I will be on this journey with you”), all in a confident, caring tone.
- ‘Mini-lesson’ on emotions: To the client seeking a guarantee, the therapist might say: “Maybe I could clarify when and why emotions can be healthy and helpful… Emotion motivates and helps you get your needs met because it tells you what is missing. For example, sadness… allows you to let go and organize to find something new; anger helps you set boundaries…; loneliness tells you what you need to feel connected… Anxiety and fear tell you that you do not feel safe and need protection. So, emotions usually tell us what we need, help us get needs met… Does that make sense?” ￼. This extended response uses concrete examples for each core emotion, teaching that each painful feeling has a purpose. It stays in simple terms and ends with a collaborative check (“Does that make sense?”) to engage the client.
- Emphasize safety and pacing: In response to trauma/safety concerns, the therapist might say: “I know it can be difficult to talk about past traumas. We will go slow and at a pace that you feel comfortable with. I actually do think it is important to be able to talk about what happened to you and process the feelings around it, in a safe place. How about we take it at a pace you feel comfortable with, where you decide how deep you want to go” ￼. This explicitly puts control in the client’s hands (“pace you feel comfortable,” “you decide how deep to go”) while gently explaining why processing trauma matters. The tone is compassionate and empowering.
- Validate then reframe worldview: For the “control = strength” belief, a therapist might respond: “Yes, it can feel very distressing when you feel out of control. And it sounds like that does leave you feeling weak. I don’t believe that controlling feelings makes you stronger, but we can explore that. In many ways, I think it is strong to be able to allow your feelings… You can then have choice over when to express them. But we can discuss it. How does that sound to you?” ￼. This acknowledges the client’s feelings of weakness, gently disagrees (“I don’t believe… but we can explore”), offers a new perspective (allowing feelings can be strength), and invites client input (“How does that sound?”). The language is careful and inclusive.
- Link to client’s goals: Addressing the anger issue, for instance: “I think we need to look into your anger a little further. Hitting people is not a good thing, and I agree that we need to work on it. Maybe we need to consider strategies to help you get anger under control. Also, it is important to look at what is driving that anger, what is underneath it. Sometimes it can be helpful to get to the feelings underneath your anger. This refocusing helps you actually get anger under control” ￼. This response first validates (“hitting is not good”) and agrees to the need for control strategies, then ties EFT to the goal: understanding underlying feelings to better manage anger. It shows respect for the client’s immediate goal (control anger) while explaining how exploring emotions serves that goal.
- Comprehensive, respectful tone: Across all advanced responses, the therapist uses a patient, organized style – explaining points step-by-step, using examples or analogies, and often checking in (“Does that make sense?”) ￼ ￼. Even when disagreeing, the therapist stays gentle (“I don’t believe that… but we can discuss”). This models to trainees how to handle deep skepticism with empathy, knowledge, and collaboration, ultimately strengthening trust and alliance.
