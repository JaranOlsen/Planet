# Instructions for Refining EFT Deliberate Practice Items

Below are guidelines to improve **client statements** and **therapist responses** for each intervention type and difficulty level (basic, intermediate, mastery). Each section outlines how to ensure the client’s line provides a clear emotional context/marker for the intended intervention, and how to elevate the therapist’s reply to expert-level **Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT)**. Common pitfalls (e.g. vague markers, overly cognitive or generic responses, missing empathic attunement) are noted with examples and improvements. Use these instructions to programmatically refine the dataset.

I want you to go through every item in the xxxxxxxxxxx section of deliberatepractice/src/data/statements.js, and improve on the statements (keep the statements consistent with the cases in deliberatepractice/src/md, but feel free to be a bit creative - remember, they are cases with a whole and nuanced life) and suggested therapist responses in that section following the instructions below:

## Therapist Self-Awareness (Internal Attunement)  
*This skill involves the therapist noticing and managing their own internal reactions in session.*  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client (Scenario) Statements:**  
- Ensure each scenario clearly identifies a **specific therapist reaction** to the client’s behavior. It should name an **internal urge or feeling** in the therapist (e.g. *“you feel a pull to brainstorm fixes”*).  
- Include an observable client cue that triggers the reaction (e.g. client speaks quickly about stress, therapist feels pressure to move fast). The scenario should connect the client’s action to the therapist’s **emotional or bodily response**.  
  - *Flaw:* “You feel something when the client talks.” (Too vague – not a clear trigger or reaction.)  
  - *Improved:* “As the client speaks rapidly about her workload, you notice your own heart rate quicken and an urge to give quick advice.” (Concrete cue and therapist reaction.)  

**Upgrading Therapist (Silent Response) Suggestions:**  
- The suggestion should model **mindful self-regulation and refocusing**. It must be phrased as a *silent self-instruction* (often in parentheses) that the therapist uses to stay present (e.g. *“(silently) Slow my breathing, ground through my feet, and refocus on her words instead of fixing.”*).  
- Emphasize **naming the therapist’s impulse internally** (e.g. notice urge to “fix” or anxiety to prove oneself) and then **redirecting to empathy** and the client’s emotion. Keep the tone gentle and encouraging.  
  - *Flaw:* “(silently) Stop it, you’re overreacting.” (Critical or vague self-talk; lacks guidance to refocus.)  
  - *Improved:* “(silently) Notice my urge to fix; take a slow breath, soften my shoulders, and return attention to her sadness.” (Acknowledges impulse and recenters on client feeling.)  
- Common pitfalls to correct: **Collusion or avoidance.** If the therapist suggestion ignores the internal cue (e.g. doesn’t mention the urge) or follows it (e.g. mentally planning instead of staying present), revise it to **maintain therapeutic presence**. For example, if the therapist feels relief when the client changes topic, the revised suggestion might be *“(silently) Recognize my relief (avoidance); stay with the earlier painful topic a moment longer.”* This ensures expert-level self-awareness and attunement.

### Intermediate Level  
**Enhancing Client (Scenario) Statements:**  
- Scenarios should feature *more intense or nuanced internal reactions* in the therapist as the client’s emotional material deepens. Clearly depict **complex therapist feelings** (defensiveness, over-identification, rescue urges) in response to client statements.  
- Include **specific client content** that challenges the therapist (e.g. client questions therapist’s competence or introduces cultural factors) and the **therapist’s internal struggle** (e.g. *“you feel a spike of defensiveness to prove you understand”*). Ensure the marker is explicit: the training scenario must highlight the exact moment and feeling for the therapist.  
  - *Flaw:* “Client mentions a tough topic and you feel stuff.” (Not specific – what topic? What does therapist feel?)  
  - *Improved:* “The client ‘expertsplains’ a technique; you notice a jolt of defensiveness and an urge to demonstrate your knowledge.” (Concrete trigger and named reaction, providing a clear marker for self-awareness.)  

**Upgrading Therapist (Silent Response) Suggestions:**  
- The response should demonstrate **advanced regulation and return to curiosity**. Have the therapist label their reaction (e.g. *“defensive”*, *“hurt pride”*) internally, then actively choose an EFT-consistent stance (e.g. *“soften and stay curious about the client’s experience instead of debating”*).  
- Incorporate *specific techniques* for grounding in the moment: e.g. reminding oneself to relax facial tension, feel the chair support, or recall the client’s underlying feeling. The language should be **calm and coaching**, e.g. *“(silently) Breathe out the urge to argue; focus on the fear behind their question.”*.  
  - *Flaw:* “(silently) Don’t be defensive, just listen.” (Acknowledges reaction but gives a blunt command without strategy or focus.)  
  - *Improved:* “(silently) Note my defensiveness; unclench jaw, stay humble and ask what makes this important for them.” (Guides the therapist to release tension and respond with empathy rather than ego.)  
- Check that the suggestion **prevents common errors**: e.g. if the therapist felt *relief* at avoiding an emotion, the suggestion should coach them to *re-engage* (“notice relief and gently bring focus back to the client’s deeper feeling”). If the therapist felt *urge to rush*, the suggestion should emphasize slowing down. Every response should model expert-level therapist presence and self-correction in line with EFT principles.

### Mastery Level  
**Enhancing Client (Scenario) Statements:**  
- Present **high-intensity or challenging scenarios** that truly test the therapist’s composure (e.g. client threatens to quit therapy, client’s pain is overwhelming, or client questions therapist’s usefulness). The statement must identify a **strong internal reaction** (frustration, panic, deep sadness) in the therapist, triggered by a clear client action or remark.  
- Use emotionally charged client cues to ensure a **clear marker**. For example, *“Client says, ‘If this doesn’t work, I’m done,’ and you feel pressure and a flicker of irritation”*. At mastery, scenarios can involve mixed emotions in the therapist (e.g. simultaneous urgency and guilt). Make sure the description captures this complexity so the intervention (therapist regulating self) is appropriately challenging.  
  - *Flaw:* “Client is very upset and you feel emotional.” (Too general; not capturing the specific therapist reaction or the intensity.)  
  - *Improved:* “The client tearfully asks ‘Is this helping at all?’; a wave of guilt and fear washes over you, and you notice an impulse to defend the therapy.” (Clear client statement and the nuanced internal response it provokes.)  

**Upgrading Therapist (Silent Response) Suggestions:**  
- The suggestion should exhibit **expert-level self-possession and use of therapeutic self**. It may involve *pausing and explicitly naming internally multiple feelings* (e.g. *“pressure + irritation”* or *“anxiety + guilt”*), and then a step-by-step grounding (slow breath, feel chair) to respond from compassion.  
- Encourage the therapist to sometimes *use their self-awareness in the relationship* (when appropriate). For example, at mastery it can include a **brief transparent self-comment** if it serves the client. E.g., if the scenario is the therapist rushing due to time, the response might be: *“(silently) Notice I’m rushing out of guilt. I can even say, ‘I realize I’m rushing; this is important so let’s slow down.’”*. Such a response shows the therapist regulating internally **and** skillfully acknowledging it in session to repair alliance.  
  - *Flaw:* “(silently) Calm down and be nice.” (Overly simplistic, doesn’t address the specific reaction or use any EFT strategy.)  
  - *Improved:* “(silently) Name my panic and irritation; soften my tone and lean in. Respond to her fear rather than my urge to defend.” (Demonstrates identifying the reaction and choosing an empathic stance in response.)  
- Ensure the tone is **confident yet humble**, modeling that even intense internal reactions can be managed. If the therapist has a sharp impulse (e.g. to give advice or to shut down), the suggestion should explicitly counter it with an empathic alternative (e.g. *“drop the urge to justify; tune into the client’s fear of being irrelevant and convey understanding”*). The result should illustrate master therapists staying **present and emotionally available** under pressure.

## Empathic Reflection (Understanding & Paraphrasing Feelings)  
*In empathic reflection, the therapist mirrors the client’s experience, capturing emotions and implicit meaning in the client’s words.*  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Each client statement should vividly convey a **specific emotional experience** and context, providing a clear “marker” for reflection. Focus on **concrete situations plus feelings** (including metaphors or bodily expressions) so the emotion is evident. For example, *“I woke up at 4am replaying every mistake and put on a ‘strong leader’ face by morning”* explicitly mixes context (4am rumination, putting on a face) with an implied feeling (anxiety, strain).  
- Ensure the statement isn’t overly general or flat. Add descriptive details or metaphors that show the **felt sense**. A good marker often contains an emotional word or a palpable image (e.g. “stomach flips,” “lump in throat”).  
  - *Flaw:* “I’m just tired of work.” (Too vague; minimal emotion or context.)  
  - *Improved:* “Every morning I feel **exhausted**, plastering on a smile so no one sees how **frayed** I am.” (Clear emotional context and imagery that invites reflection.)  
- Avoid purely cognitive or factual statements. If a line is mostly a thought (“I think I messed up the project”), integrate how that thought **feels** (“…and it’s eating at me inside”). The client statement should essentially hand the therapist an emotional thread to reflect.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Reflections should **accurately echo the core emotion and situation** in the client’s words, in fresh language that shows understanding. Ensure the therapist response *captures the feeling explicitly* (naming it or using a fitting metaphor) and stays close to the client’s frame.  
- Use **second-person (“you”) or first-person from client’s perspective (“I” statements in quotes)** to voice the client’s internal state. Keep the tone empathic and succinct. For instance: *Client:* “My chest tightens every time the calendar pings.” *Therapist (improved):* “**Each ping tightens your chest like a strap**.” This response zeroes in on the physical emotion and its intensity.  
  - *Flaw:* “You have a lot going on at work.” (Overly broad, cognitive summary; misses the specific feeling of tight chest and anxiety.)  
  - *Improved:* “**Each new task makes your chest clamp down with anxiety**.” (Focuses on the client’s actual felt experience, showing precise understanding.)  
- Avoid adding advice, analysis, or shifting tense away from the immediate experience. A common mistake is to soften the reflection or make it past tense (e.g. “it **was** hard for you” instead of “**is** hard”). Keep it present and empathically resonant. If the original suggestion is too **surface-level or missing the emotion**, deepen it: e.g. if client says “I laugh with my crew at work but driving home I ache,” a weak reflection might be “You feel different at home.” An expert reflection would be *“You can laugh with them, but the **drive home leaves you with a hollow ache** because they don’t know the real you”*. This not only reflects the feeling (“hollow ache”) but also the reason, demonstrating nuanced empathy.  
- Check for **empathic resonance**: the therapist’s words should make it clear they *feel* what the client feels. If a response sounds perfunctory or merely rephrased, infuse an emotional word or image from the client’s cue. For instance, client: “I keep a spare blazer at my desk so I never look as wrinkled as I feel.” A reflective miss might ignore the metaphor (“You want to appear put-together”). A better response: *“That spare blazer feels like **armor over how worn-out** you feel”* – using the client’s metaphor (“armor”) and explicitly naming “worn-out” conveys fuller understanding.

### Intermediate Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- At intermediate, client statements can be slightly more complex or mixed in emotion, but still must clearly signal an emotional **theme** for reflection. Often these markers might include **two feelings or a conflict** (“part of me does X, but I feel Y”). Ensure the statement captures that inner struggle or layered emotion in a concrete way. For example: *“I took a night off but a voice kept whispering someone else will outpace me if I rest”* – this shows conflict (desire to rest vs. fear) and gives the feeling (insecurity, pressure) a voice.  
- Encourage **emotionally rich language**: incorporate specific feelings (hurt, fear, longing, anger) or analogies. If the draft is too factual, weave in what the client *feels or imagines.* For instance, instead of “I imagine my ex watching me burn out,” enhance it: “I imagine my ex watching me burn out and it **just guts me**”. Now it presents a visceral emotion (“guts me”) inviting a reflection of emotional pain.  
- Avoid markers that are so long or detailed that the emotion gets lost. Keep them focused: one scenario, one or two emotions. If needed, trim extraneous details that don’t contribute to the emotional tone. The goal is a clear signal for the therapist to mirror.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Reflections at this level should be **slightly more nuanced**, possibly reflecting multiple feelings or an emotional ambivalence. The therapist can capture the *tension* or contrast present. For example, *“Longing and panic tangled together”* or *“You nod to keep peace while your throat burns”*. These kinds of reflections acknowledge both sides of the client’s experience. Ensure the suggestion doesn’t oversimplify if the client has mixed feelings.  
- Continue to use vivid language and metaphors that match the client’s. If the client uses a metaphor or symbolic language, the therapist can extend or echo it. E.g., client: “I keep imagining my ex saying ‘she was too much’”; therapist improved: “Imagining your ex watching you burn out **stings like proof you were ‘too much’**”. This adds the word “stings” to convey the pain, deepening the empathic quality.  
  - *Flaw:* **Missing nuance:** Client shares two feelings (“panic and longing”), but therapist reflects only one (“You feel afraid about it”). This loses part of the marker.  
  - *Improved:* “Even ‘Eid’ brings **panic and longing tangled together**”. This reflection explicitly mirrors both feelings in a concise, emotionally resonant way.  
- Check the tone for **validating the experience** inherent in the reflection. While pure reflection doesn’t add new meaning, it should still carry an undertone of “I get it.” If the current suggestion sounds mechanical or purely parroting, infuse a gentle **“of course” or a metaphor** to convey acceptance of that emotional reality (without turning it into a formal validation statement). For example, if a client confesses “I bargain with my body – ‘one more iteration’ – until I can’t hear it,” an empathic reflection might be *“You bargain with your body – ‘one more iteration’ – until you **can’t hear its pleas anymore**”*. This stays in the client’s frame but underscores the poignancy of ignoring the body, showing the therapist truly heard the dilemma.

### Mastery Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Mastery-level client statements should depict **high emotional intensity or deeper personal meaning**, giving an expert therapist a rich moment to reflect. They may involve existential feelings (worthlessness, despair, profound fear) embedded in concrete imagery. For example: *“Sometimes I stare at the screen until sunrise and think if I disappeared, **no one would even know what I’ve been carrying**.”* This provides a strong marker of invisibility and burden. Ensure such statements are **evocative and specific**, not just “I feel very bad.”  
- Use dramatic or poignant scenarios that an expert therapist would catch (e.g. drafting a resignation letter and rereading it, fantasizing about quitting in a vivid image). Emphasize the emotional meaning: *“like a ghost life I might choose”* or *“vacation sounds like a language I forgot”*. These phrases carry clear emotional weight (hopelessness, alienation). If a mastery client line lacks that punch, elevate it with metaphor, symbolism, or reference to core needs/values being threatened.  
  - *Flaw:* “Sometimes I want to quit.” (Bare feeling, no context or depth.)  
  - *Improved:* “There’s a moment before dawn I wonder if I should just **quit before I collapse in front of everyone**.” (Includes time/context and the fear/shame element “collapse in front of everyone,” which is a strong emotional marker for the therapist to reflect.)  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Mastery reflections should demonstrate attunement to the **subtle and profound layers** of the client’s message. Therapists can reflect not just the obvious emotion, but the *implicit pain or fear* underneath. Use imagery if present, or gently infer the emotional significance in the client’s metaphor. For example, client says they feel invisible working all night: therapist might respond, *“Some nights at the screen you feel **invisible** – no one sees the weight you carry”*. This captures both the invisibility *and* explicitly mentions “the weight you carry,” highlighting the burden unacknowledged.  
- If the client’s statement contains a figurative expression or extreme wording, honor it in the reflection to show you fully heard it. E.g., client: “If I disappeared, I’d **pixelate into the air without anyone catching the pieces**.” A strong reflection could be, *“That image of **pixelating away** shows how **invisible and spent** you feel right now.”* This uses the client’s image (“pixelating away”) and adds empathic descriptors (“invisible and spent”) to convey deep understanding.  
  - *Flaw:* Tone-deaf or minimizing response. E.g., *Client:* “I fear I could shut my laptop and never open it.” *Therapist flawed:* “You’re really stressed about work.” (This generic response misses the despair and drastic tone of the client’s statement.)  
  - *Improved:* *“You **fear you could snap the laptop shut mid-meeting and not open it again**.”* This response is almost verbatim but framed as an empathic understanding of the fear, preserving the intensity (“snap…not open again”). It shows the therapist isn’t afraid of the client’s strong wording, reflecting it back calmly.  
- Ensure **no judgment or dilution** enters the reflection. Mastery-level clients often offer statements laced with shame or extreme hopelessness. The therapist’s job in reflection is to **stay with those feelings**. If a suggestion currently sidesteps the depth (maybe by using a euphemism or focusing on a secondary detail), rewrite it to mirror the core sentiment. For instance, client: “I’m scared one day I’ll just close the laptop and never reopen it.” A tepid reflection (“You sometimes think about stopping work.”) loses the fear and finality. A corrected reflection might be exactly as the client said but acknowledging the fear: *“**You’re afraid you might just shut the laptop one day and never reopen it**.”* Simple, but directly resonating with the client’s spoken fear.  
- At this level, reflections can sometimes *“read between the lines”* slightly – but **only in service of clarifying the emotion already implied**, not introducing new ideas. For example, if a client says “I feel guilty fantasizing about a simpler job, like it means I’m ungrateful,” a reflection might gently underline the conflict: *“Holding that fantasy **feels like being ungrateful** – achieving the dream job doesn’t cancel how drained you are.”* This edges into validation, but still fundamentally reflects the client’s stated guilt and reason for it. Use this judiciously: the reflection should sound like *you are in the client’s world*, finishing their unspoken thought or highlighting the pain in it, rather than an outsider analyzing.

## Empathic Validation (Affirmation of Feelings and Needs)  
*In empathic validation, the therapist not only reflects the client’s experience but **normalizes and affirms** it – conveying that the feeling “makes sense” given the context. These responses often include phrases like “of course” or “makes perfect sense” and connect the emotion to the client’s history or situation.*  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Client statements for validation should present a **vulnerable feeling or self-criticism** that needs normalizing. They often contain negative self-judgment or doubt (“I shouldn’t need this…”, “It’s embarrassing that…”). Ensure each statement clearly shows an emotional struggle where the client feels “wrong” or inadequate for feeling what they feel. For example: *“I keep telling myself to suck it up because other people manage worse.”* This reveals guilt/shame for struggling, which is a perfect entry for validation (“it makes sense you feel that way”).  
- Include context if needed to justify the emotion. If a line is just self-criticism with no context (“I’m so weak for feeling this”), you can add a hint of what the client has been enduring (“…after months of X, I feel weak…”). This ensures the therapist has something to affirm as reasonable.  
  - *Flaw:* “I shouldn’t be upset.” (Very generic; doesn’t tell why the client feels they shouldn’t, or what they actually feel.)  
  - *Improved:* “It’s **embarrassing** how much I want someone to say I’m doing enough.” Now the statement shows a specific longing and shame about it – an emotional setup for validation (“of course you’d long for reassurance…”).  
- The marker for validation is often an *emotion plus a judgment of that emotion*. Make sure both elements are present. E.g., “Part of me feels guilty for resenting the job I fought to have.” – here the feeling (resentment) and the guilt about it are explicit. These are strong validation cues.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Validations should **explicitly convey acceptance and legitimacy** of the client’s emotion. The hallmark of expert validation is a phrase indicating it “makes sense” or is “understandable,” tied to the client’s unique situation. Start responses with expressions like “It makes sense that…”, “Of course you…”, “Naturally…”, “Anyone in your shoes…”. For example: *“It’s natural to compare, yet the pressure you’re under would strain anyone – your struggle doesn’t make you weak.”*. This both normalizes (“would strain anyone”) and directly counters the client’s negative self-judgment (“doesn’t make you weak”).  
- Check that the response **mirrors the client’s specific context** when affirming. Generic validations (“That’s totally normal”) can feel hollow. Instead, reference the client’s actual circumstances or efforts: e.g. *“Makes perfect sense after all you’ve been carrying alone”* or *“completely human – it doesn’t mean you’re failing.”*. Tailoring the validation to details the client provided shows deep understanding.  
  - *Flaw:* “Don’t feel bad, anyone would feel that.” (While intending to normalize, it can sound dismissive or too general, and it doesn’t use the client’s context.)  
  - *Improved:* “**Wanting reassurance after working nonstop is completely human – it doesn’t mean you’re failing**.” (Addresses the client’s exact worry about needing reassurance, and normalizes it in context.)  
- Include **both parts**: acknowledge the painful feeling *and* affirm it as reasonable. For instance, client: “It’s embarrassing how much I want approval.” Therapist might say, *“Of course you’d long to hear you’re doing enough after pouring everything in – that longing doesn’t mean you’re weak.”* This response first validates the longing (“of course after pouring everything in”) and pre-empts the shame (“doesn’t mean you’re weak”). If the current suggestion only does one part (just “it makes sense” without referencing the client’s situation, or vice versa), adjust it to have both.  
- Pay attention to **empathic tone**. A good validation feels warm and assuring, not clinical. Phrases like “completely natural,” “makes perfect sense,” “anyone would…” are useful. Ensure the language is supportive. If a suggestion is phrased too factually (“Yes, that is valid because X”), soften it. E.g., change “Your reaction is logical given X” to *“It makes sense you’d react that way, given X.”* The latter is more relational and gentle.  
- Avoid **over-validating by minimizing the issue**. For example, if a client says “I shouldn’t need reassurance,” a poor response would be “Oh, that’s nothing, everybody needs reassurance.” This accidentally downplays their struggle. Instead, validate **the difficulty** of feeling that need: *“It’s completely understandable to crave reassurance after all this pressure – it doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you.”* This approach validates without trivializing. The provided suggestions often model this well by merging empathy with normalization, e.g., *“Holding both gratitude and resentment makes perfect sense – achieving the dream doesn’t cancel the toll it’s taking.”*. Emulate that balance.

### Intermediate Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Intermediate validation markers can show **more acute dilemmas or fears of judgment**. The client might anticipate criticism or have a deeper belief of personal flaw. Make sure the statement highlights that worry. For example: *“If I say I’m overwhelmed, they’ll think they promoted the wrong person.”* clearly identifies a fear of judgment. Such a statement is ripe for validation (“anyone would worry about being seen as wrong for the role”).  
- Include any relevant background in brief (e.g. “after years of proving myself, part of me thinks asking for help is selfish”). This connects the emotion to history, which the therapist can use in their affirmation. E.g. *“Part of me wants to ask for help, then I hear that voice saying I’m selfish.”* – this has context (years of self-reliance implied) and the self-critical voice.  
- If a client statement at this level is too tame or simplistic, consider adding a **twinge of shame, guilt, or conflict** to elevate it. For instance, instead of “I want help but I don’t ask,” make it “Part of me wants to ask for help, but I feel selfish even thinking about it.” This duality sets up a validation (“it’s understandable you’d feel that way given…”).  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Provide **contextual normalization**: tie the validation to the client’s circumstances or past efforts. The therapist response should reflect the client’s perspective and then broaden it to a universal or reasonable perspective. For example, *“It’s completely understandable that asking feels selfish when you’ve spent years proving you can hold it all.”* Here, the therapist notes the client’s history (“years proving you can hold it all”) as the reason the current feeling makes sense. This is more powerful than simply “It’s understandable you want help.”  
- Use **“of course” / “understandable” / “natural”** language and explicitly counter any negative self-evaluation embedded in the client’s remark. E.g., if the client fears being “selfish,” the therapist might say, “It’s *completely understandable* you’d feel that conflict – it **doesn’t mean** you’re selfish; it means you’ve been carrying so much alone.” This both normalizes and removes the sting of the label.  
  - *Flaw:* Omitting the self-criticism. If client says “I hear a voice saying I’m selfish,” and the therapist only responds “It’s understandable you want help,” they missed directly addressing the “selfish” fear.  
  - *Improved:* “**It’s completely understandable that asking feels selfish** given how you’ve had to manage alone – wanting support **doesn’t actually make you selfish at all**.” (Addresses the fear head-on and normalizes the need.)  
- Introduce **humanizing perspectives** (“anyone in your position…,” “when praise has hinged on output, of course easing up feels risky”). This helps the client see their reaction as a human one, not a personal failing. Ensure each validation is specific: rather than a generic “anyone would feel that,” specify **what** anyone would feel *in their specific situation*. For instance, *“Anyone in your position, under this kind of pressure, would struggle – your reaction isn’t a weakness.”*  
- Maintain an **empathic, confident tone** that carries conviction. A good validation sounds like the therapist truly believes the client’s emotion is reasonable. If a suggestion is phrased tentatively (“Maybe it makes sense that…?”), strengthen it to a firmer stance (“It makes sense that…”). The client should feel the therapist’s reassurance.  
- Double-check the **logic and accuracy**: the rationale the therapist offers must truly fit the client’s narrative. If a draft validation introduces a mismatch (e.g., “It’s logical you feel X because of Y,” but Y isn’t something the client has mentioned or is slightly off), adjust it to align with the client’s story. For instance, if the client hasn’t explicitly mentioned “months of pouring everything out” but has implied hard work, it’s safe to include (as the dataset does). But don’t add new facts. Keep the validation grounded in what’s known of the client. This ensures authenticity and expert precision.

### Mastery Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Mastery-level validation statements involve the client revealing **deeper fears of being “too much,” weak, or unlovable** if they show need or vulnerability. They often contain dramatic language of self-judgment or catastrophic expectation of others’ judgment. Ensure the statement has that high-stakes personal meaning. For example: *“If I crumble, I worry everyone will see the needy mess underneath.”* This is a clear marker: the client fears being exposed as “a mess,” an ideal setup for a validating response.  
- These statements may also express a poignant wish or guilt (e.g. fantasizing about escape and feeling guilty). Make the emotional conflict explicit: *“There’s a part of me that wants permission to hand things over without proving I’m on the brink.”* shows the longing for relief versus the pressure to appear unbreakable. The stronger and more specific this conflict or fear, the better the intervention target.  
- If needed, heighten the language to *match mastery intensity*: e.g., “burn myself out quietly” vs “sometimes I think I have to destroy myself to keep respect.” Don’t shy away from powerful wording that a client might actually use in a desperate moment. This gives the therapist the opportunity to deliver a profound validation.  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Mastery validations should come across as **deeply compassionate truths** that reframe the client’s harsh view of themselves. The therapist response often will **name the hidden logic** in the client’s behavior or fear in a way the client hasn’t articulated, in addition to normalizing. For example, *“Given how respect has been tied to your output, it makes sense it feels like you have to sacrifice yourself to keep it.”*. This response shows expert understanding of the client’s world (respect tied to output) and validates the extreme measure (self-sacrifice) as a felt necessity, not insanity.  
- Use **cause-and-effect language** that links the client’s experience to the past or context. E.g., “when you’ve been the steady one, **of course** letting the mask drop feels terrifying”. Or, “after so long carrying this alone, naturally you’d crave permission to stop without feeling selfish”. These statements acknowledge the *history or dynamic* that makes the current feeling reasonable. This level of attunement exemplifies mastery.  
  - *Flaw:* Over-generalizing or simply cheering. E.g., client: “I fear they’d call me dramatic if I say how close I am to breaking.” Poor therapist: “You’re not being dramatic.” (This dismisses client’s fear and doesn’t explain why it’s natural to have that fear.)  
  - *Improved:* “**Given how you’ve been valued for being unshakeable, it makes sense** you’d fear being labeled dramatic for telling the truth.” (This response explicitly ties the fear to the client’s context – always being the strong one – and validates that *of course* they’d worry about that label.)  
- Mastery responses can elegantly **counter the client’s inner critic or anticipated stigma** without bluntly contradicting (“No, you’re not X”). Instead of directly negating the client’s negative label, *contextualize* it: e.g., “That fantasy doesn’t make you ungrateful – it shows how depleted you are and how natural it is to crave ease.”. The format “doesn’t mean X – it means Y” is useful: it takes the client’s self-judgment (“ungrateful”) and flips it into a normalized need (“craving rest after being depleted”). Use this strategy to transform self-criticism into an understandable human response.  
- Maintain **warmth and steadiness** in tone. An expert validation at mastery level reads almost like a compassionate truth reframe the client can’t give themselves. Ensure the wording is neither patronizing nor overly intellectual. It should **feel emotionally resonant**. For instance, *“Wanting that permission makes sense – you’ve carried so much for so long without anyone recognizing the toll.”*. The therapist isn’t lecturing; they sound allied with the client’s deepest feelings. That is the effect to aim for.  
- Finally, review that each validation does not inadvertently undermine the emotion. Sometimes, in trying to normalize, one might accidentally say something that minimizes (“it’s not a big deal, everyone feels that”). The expert style, however, is to *honor how big a deal it actually is and still say it’s understandable*. E.g., *“Of course that fear shows up – letting the mask drop **can feel terrifying** when you’ve been the steady one.”*. Here we’re validating the **intensity** of the fear (terrifying) as well as its existence. Always validate the magnitude if the client expresses it. This assures the client the therapist fully acknowledges what they’re going through.

## Empathic Exploration (Focusing and Deepening Experience)  
*Empathic exploration involves the therapist inviting the client to **stay with their present feelings** to uncover more (often using focusing prompts: “what’s that like inside?”). Client statements for this intervention typically present an unclear or emerging feeling (a “marker” of something vague, like a buzz, lump, or mix of feelings). Therapist responses encourage the client to turn attention inward and describe the felt experience.*  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Client statements should describe a **physical sensation or fuzzy feeling** that the client hasn’t fully understood (“I have this… I don’t know what it is”). Common markers: *“There’s this [buzzy feeling, lump in throat, tightness] I can’t name,”* or *“something in me tugs/aches and I brush it off.”* The statement must clearly present an **experiential cue** – often using words like *“feels…”, “something…”, “a part of me…”* plus a location or quality. For example: *“There’s this buzzy feeling in my chest I can’t even name.”*. This is an ideal focusing marker.  
- If a client line is too cognitive (“I keep thinking I’m fine but maybe not”), convert it to a felt sense: “I keep saying I’m fine, but **something underneath keeps tugging at me**.” Now it’s an unclear internal experience (“tugging underneath”) that begs exploration.  
- Keep statements *short and focused on the sensation*. They should not explain or analyze the feeling; rather, they should highlight that the client notices it but usually avoids or can’t interpret it. If the draft contains an explanation, strip it down to the raw feeling. E.g., “There’s a wobble behind my ribs when I open Jira, **but I brush past it**” clearly shows the phenomenon and that it’s being ignored. That sets up the exploration prompt nicely.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Therapist prompts should be **open-ended invitations to explore the present moment feeling**, using gentle, curious language. They often include: “Could we…,” “Let’s stay with…,” “What’s it like…,” “Would it be okay to…?” to get the client to **attend to the sensation** without judgment. For example, *“That buzzy feeling in your chest – let’s slow down with it and sense its texture right now.”*. This response zeroes in on the “buzzy feeling” the client mentioned and invites exploration (“sense its texture”).  
- Ensure the response **uses the client’s exact or similar words for the sensation** (“buzzy feeling,” “tug,” “flutter”) to signal you’re following *their* experience. Then add a focusing instruction: e.g. *“Could we give it a bit more room?”*, *“what happens if we don’t rush past it?”*, or *“where do you feel it, and what does it bring up?”*. This combination validates the sensation and gently probes it.  
  - *Flaw:* Asking an intellectual question or leading away from the feeling. E.g., client says “a lump in my throat,” flawed therapist asks, “Why do you think you feel that way?” (This pulls the client into analysis rather than experiencing.)  
  - *Improved:* “**There’s that lump – would it be okay to just notice it with me and see what feeling might be inside it?**” (Encourages direct attention to the sensation and curiosity about it, not analysis.)  
- Keep the tone **permissive and cautious**. Phrases like “would it be okay,” “could we,” “let’s… if it’s alright” are important especially at basic level to ensure the client feels safe to look inward. The suggestion should never *demand* (“Focus on that now.” would be too blunt). Instead: *“Could we hover with it for a moment?”* or *“What is it like if we give that tug a little room?”*. This models expert gentleness in deepening an emotion.  
- If the current suggestion misses the actual felt sense or is too vague, refine it. For example, if client said “flutter in my throat” and the therapist suggestion was “Tell me more about that,” it’s too broad. Better to anchor in the experience: *“Let’s stay with that flutter – what do you notice in your throat if we don’t rush past it?”*. This explicitly mentions the sensation and instructs the client how to approach it (by not rushing).  
- Additionally, use **present tense** and sensory language. Instead of “what did it feel like when…”, say “what *does* it feel like *right now* as you mention it?” This aligns with EFT’s focus on present experience. Many provided suggestions do this: *“Those stinging eyes… would it be okay to notice them with me and see what feeling wants to be known?”* – present tense “stinging” and anthropomorphizing the feeling (“what feeling wants to be known”) invites exploration in an experiential manner.

### Intermediate Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Intermediate exploration markers might involve **multiple or complex feelings** that the client can sense but not disentangle (“a mix of anger and sadness I can’t separate”) or a vague part/voice inside (“a younger version of me pops up then vanishes”). Ensure the statement clearly presents this phenomenon of *partially known feelings*. E.g., *“There’s this mix of anger and sadness I can’t separate.”* is a textbook marker – two emotions tangled, client unsure.  
- These statements can also reference **imagery or inner voices** that hint at deeper meaning (like an inner child or internal critic glimpsed). For instance: *“A younger version of me pops up whispering ‘don’t show cracks’ then vanishes.”*. This gives the therapist something specific to focus on (the younger voice) and explore its message. So include such detail if relevant.  
- If a statement is too resolved (e.g., “I realize I’m both angry and sad about X,” which shows the client already sorted it out), make it less resolved to warrant exploration: “I feel anger and sadness tangled together and I **don’t know what to do with them**.” The uncertainty is key.  
- Keep encouraging descriptions of **bodily experience or sudden shifts** (like “the moment I close my laptop, there’s a whoosh in my chest I can’t label”). Such content is ideal for focusing interventions.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Therapist prompts at intermediate can go a bit further: they might suggest personifying parts of the experience or exploring each element of a mix. For example, *“Let’s stay with each strand for a moment – what is the sadness like, and how does the anger feel?”*. This shows the therapist guiding the client to differentiate two emotions. Ensure the suggestion addresses the complexity presented. If the client mentions two feelings, explicitly invite exploration of both (one after the other, gently).  
- Use language that **welcomes internal voices or images** into the conversation. E.g., *“Can we invite that younger voice a little closer and see what it wants you to know?”*. This kind of prompt validates the appearance of an inner part and encourages curiosity about it, which is expert EFT focusing work.  
  - *Flaw:* Ignoring the nuance. For instance, client says they have a younger part saying “don’t show cracks.” A poor prompt: “Why do you think you feel that?” (again, too analytical, ignoring the part). Another poor prompt: “Just focus on your sadness” (ignoring the “younger voice” aspect).  
  - *Improved:* “**Could we bring our attention to that younger part that whispers ‘don’t show cracks’? Maybe let it come closer – what might it be trying to tell you?**” This respects the part as its own entity and invites exploration of its message, which is an expert technique.  
- Maintain the **collaborative, permissive tone**, but you can challenge a bit more at this level by directly suggesting exploration of specific facets. E.g., *“What happens inside as it drops (from swell to hollow)? Could we explore that shift?”*. We’re still not *telling* the client what it means, just directing their attention to dynamic phenomena in their experience.  
- If the therapist suggestion is currently too timid or generic (“Can you tell me more about that mix?”), make it more focused and experiential: “Let’s gently **touch each feeling** – if you sit with the sadness, what do you sense? And the anger, what’s it like in your body?” This breaks down the task in a concrete way, as a skilled EFT therapist would.  
- Also consider **time-bound invitations** or conditionals to reduce overwhelm: “if it had a voice,” “for a minute,” “a little closer.” E.g., *“Could we linger with it and, if it had a voice, what might it worry about?”* or *“Could we stay with the tight throat and that spark – what might each be trying to show you?”*. These phrases model advanced empathy by hypothesizing that the sensations have something to communicate. Ensure such wording is included where appropriate to demonstrate that expert curiosity and assumption of meaning in bodily feelings.  

### Mastery Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Mastery-level focusing markers may be **even more subtle or evocative** – perhaps a deep almost-conscious part or a moment of potential breakthrough that the client instinctively resists. They might describe very fleeting experiences or profound images. For example: *“Sometimes I sense this younger part of me pleading, but I can't quite hear her.”* – a subtle inner plea, clearly a marker for chair/focusing work. Or *“Right before dawn, something in me wants to break open, then I clamp down.”* – a strong image of opening then closing, signaling a critical edge of experience. These are excellent mastery statements: ensure they remain vivid and puzzling to the client, indicating rich material just under the surface.  
- Include any symbolic or dreamlike elements (foggy spaces, voices, visions) the client reports, as these challenge the therapist to work at a deeper level. For instance: *“There’s a foggy space between finishing a sprint and starting the next where I feel weightless and scared.”* gives a setting (“foggy space”) and two feelings (“weightless and scared”) – a complex inner landscape for exploration.  
- If a statement lacks that depth, consider adding an **internal metaphor** or a critical moment. E.g., a plain “Sometimes I want to break down but I don’t” could be enriched to “I feel something wants to **burst out** of me, and then I **slam the door on it**.” More imagery and action – making the unknown experience concrete and compelling.  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Mastery-level exploration prompts often incorporate **imagery and parts work language** fluidly. The therapist meets the client at this deeper level: *“Would it be okay to tune toward that younger part together and notice what she’s longing for?”*. This suggests the therapist is right alongside the client (“together”) and encourages direct contact with the inner child’s need. Ensure suggestions for mastery markers use similarly compassionate and direct engagement with the image/part.  
- Encourage the client to **experience the edge of the emotion safely**. For a scenario like “something wants to break open then I clamp down,” a therapist might say: *“Let’s explore that split second before the clamp – what do you notice as it wants to open?”*. This is a precise focus: targeting the moment of “wanting to open.” Edit suggestions to pinpoint such critical moments and invite the client to pause there.  
  - *Flaw:* Being too broad or missing the moment. E.g., “So you feel weightless and scared, huh?” That neither invites exploration nor leverages the foggy metaphor.  
  - *Improved:* “**Could we step into that foggy space together and notice what the weightlessness and fear are trying to tell you?**”. This response explicitly uses the client’s metaphor (“step into that foggy space”) and personifies the feelings (“what they are trying to tell you”), demonstrating advanced exploratory technique.  
- The tone can be even more **reassuring of safety** here, since mastery tasks often dance near very vulnerable material. Therapists might add reassurances like “I’m right here with you” or “we’ll just take a peek.” For example: *“Would it feel okay to let that tiny voice speak for a moment here and see what rest means to her?”* includes “would it feel okay” and implies a very brief experiment (“for a moment”). Ensure any prompt that approaches a potentially intense inner experience has these verbal safety nets.  
- Leverage **the client’s own metaphors/words** heavily. If they mention a “horizon asking ‘what now?’” as in a case of existential doubt, a therapist might respond, *“The water spreads out endless and questioning, almost like it’s waiting for your next move – could we sit with that question it’s asking you?”*. This builds directly on the metaphor, encouraging the client to derive meaning from it. The dataset does this, e.g., with the fjord horizon: *“The water spreads endless and questioning, almost like it’s waiting for your next sketch.”*. Emulate this creativity and attunement.  
- Confirm that suggestions **do not solve or interpret** the experience; they stay exploratory. Even at mastery, the therapist should not jump to conclusions like “maybe that means X.” Instead, they facilitate the client’s own discovery: “what is that part longing for?”, “what does that image hold?”. If any suggestion veers into interpretation (“perhaps the fog means you’re confused”), change it to a question or prompt (“what does the fog seem to hold?”). Master therapists trust the client’s experiential process to reveal the truth if gently supported.

## Empathic Evocation (Heightening Vividness with Metaphor)  
*Empathic evocation involves the therapist responding with imagery or metaphor that captures and intensifies the client’s emotional experience, often making the implicit feeling more explicit through creative language. The client’s statement typically contains an emotion that could be illustrated, and the therapist offers a vivid analogy, symbol, or picture that resonates with that feeling.*  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Client statements for evocation should be **relatively brief and clear in emotional tone**, providing raw material for imagery. They may already include simple metaphors or sensory descriptions, or they may be straightforward feelings that beg for a picture. For instance: *“I’m just tired.”* is plain, but it strongly conveys exhaustion – a blank canvas for a metaphor. Another: *“My inbox feels like a hive that never sleeps.”* – here the client *provided* a metaphor (“hive that never sleeps”), which is great material to extend or reflect back evocatively.  
- Ensure each statement has at least one **emotional keyword or image**. If it’s too bare, add a descriptive element. Instead of “I keep moving forward, that’s all,” maybe “I keep moving forward like a machine.” But careful: if the dataset expects *therapist* to come up with metaphor, don’t overfill the client side with elaborate metaphors – just enough to inspire. It’s okay if some basics are short (“I’m just tired”) as long as the feeling is clear. Others might have mild figurative language.  
- The emotional context should be obvious: e.g., “Each sprint review is just another mountain copied and pasted” already is metaphorical, conveying monotony and fatigue. If a basic statement is bland, spice it up with a hint of metaphor or a concrete scenario (“coffee tastes like survival instead of warmth now” is a good model – concrete item “coffee” + emotional connotation shift).  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- The therapist’s response should **amplify the emotional image or create one if none given, in a way that resonates deeply**. Use rich sensory language and analogies that match the client’s feeling. For example, client: “I’m just tired.” Therapist might evoke: *“It sounds like you’re **running on fumes, like your system is a battery blinking red**.”*. This paints a vivid picture of near depletion, which *feels* more than just saying “very tired.”  
- If the client provided a metaphor, the therapist can **extend or reframe it creatively**. E.g., client: “my inbox feels like a hive that never sleeps.” Therapist could say, *“It’s like the hive keeps buzzing around you, **asking for honey you no longer have to give**.”*. This keeps the “hive” image but adds the twist of the client having no honey (energy) left – intensifying the emotional impact (feeling drained). Ensure suggestions do this kind of **yes-and** with the client’s imagery.  
  - *Flaw:* A literal or dry reflection instead of evocation. E.g., client: “Coffee tastes like survival, not warmth.” Flawed therapist: “You only drink coffee to survive, no enjoyment.” (Accurate but not evocative.)  
  - *Improved:* “**Even your coffee has turned into ration fuel – more bunker brew than morning comfort.**” This takes “coffee = survival” and turns it into a vivid metaphor (“bunker brew”) contrasting with what it used to be (“morning comfort”). It paints a scenario (like wartime ration vs cozy morning) that dramatizes the emotional shift.  
- Ensure the metaphors align with the client’s world or at least are relatable. Great evocations often use imagery from the client’s context (tech, nature, etc. – the dataset does with references like “pixelate into the air” for a tech context, or “lantern glow” for a parenting context). If a suggestion’s metaphor seems out of left field or mismatched, adjust it. For instance, a client in a corporate context might resonate with tech or office metaphors, whereas a more personal/home context might use domestic imagery.  
- Keep metaphors **concise and potent**. One or two striking images is usually enough. Avoid overloading the response with multiple disparate metaphors which can dilute impact. For example, *“climbing the same mountain on repeat, the scenery never changing.”* is effective and singular. A mistake would be mixing too many (e.g., “It’s like you’re climbing a mountain and also a hamster on a wheel” – pick one).  
- Also preserve empathic attunement within the metaphor. The therapist isn’t just being poetic for its own sake – the image should *validate or emphasize the emotion*. E.g., *“like holding your breath underwater longer than any person should”* for “Keeping quiet is exhausting” uses an extreme image to validate how hard it is (any person would struggle to hold breath that long). Check each metaphor actually speaks to the client’s feeling in a meaningful way (ask: if someone said this to me in that state, would I feel understood?). If not, tweak for resonance.  

### Intermediate Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- At intermediate, clients might articulate feelings with a *touch more detail*, which can include simple metaphors or emotionally loaded objects. The statements should still clearly convey a single feeling or theme that can be amplified. Some might already hint at imagery, but possibly less directly, leaving the therapist room to develop it. E.g., *“The office lights feel harsh lately.”* – a simple statement of discomfort that invites metaphor (harsh lights could become interrogators in therapist’s response, as indeed they did). Ensure statements have these evocative kernels (harsh lights, endless skyline of deadlines, dreams in error messages, etc.).  
- If needed, incorporate a concrete noun or setting tied to the emotion: e.g., stress becomes “office lights,” overwhelming workload becomes “calendar skyline.” The dataset’s client lines often do this, which gives the therapist something tangible to latch onto. If a draft line is too abstract (“I feel overwhelmed”), make it concrete (“My calendar looks like a skyline of deadlines with no horizon” – which is actually one of the lines).  
- You can allow a bit more **color or dramatic flair** in client lines at this level (though still believable as client self-expression). For example, “I dream in error messages and status updates” – a techie dramatic expression of work invading dreams. These kinds of lines set up the therapist to respond creatively. So include them or polish them for clarity and emotional punch if they exist.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Intermediate therapist evocations can be *even more imaginative*, perhaps layered or extended metaphors that precisely fit the client’s reference. For instance, the harsh office lights example: *“Those lights sound like interrogators, spotlighting you when you already feel raw.”*. This turns “harsh lights” into an entire scene of being under interrogation, which vividly conveys feeling exposed and stressed. Make sure each suggestion does something similar: take the client’s object or scenario and **expand it in an emotionally illustrative way**.  
- Pay attention to subtle cues in client language and riff on them. Client: “Walking into the standup feels like stepping onto a stage in a suit of cracked glass.”. That line is already complex. The therapist suggestion *maintains the image but adds meaning*: *“So you’re out there in brittle armor, hoping no one sees the fractures beneath the polish.”*. It kept the idea of cracked armor (brittle) and spelled out “fractures beneath the polish,” highlighting vulnerability behind the professional exterior. Aim for such finesse – use the client’s metaphorical elements (“cracked glass suit” becomes “brittle armor with fractures”) and draw out the emotional implication (fear of being seen broken).  
  - *Flaw:* Overdoing or misfiring. A therapist might get carried away and use an image that doesn’t fit the client’s experience or is too convoluted. E.g., client: “Counting metrics is the only thing that makes sense.” A mismatched response: “It’s like you’re clinging to a single tree in a storm of chaos, focusing on its bark pattern.” (Huh? original context was metrics; a tree metaphor might confuse the client).  
  - *Improved:* *“It’s as though those metrics are the last rails keeping the train from tipping over.”*. This stays in a realm that fits (metrics as rails of a train – implying structure amidst chaos) and dramatizes the fear of collapse. Always align metaphors with the **client’s context or a universal experience of the emotion**.  
- Check that the evocation **amplifies the feeling but stays empathic**. It should not come off as sarcastic or as mockery. For example, if a client says “I feel like a fraud,” a supportive evocation might be “It’s like you’re wearing a costume that doesn’t fit, worried the seams will show,” rather than something that might sound judgmental or bizarre. The provided examples are usually empathic in tone even when imaginative.  
- Intermediate responses might use slightly more **elaborate imagery** than basic, perhaps two linked elements. E.g., *“a skyline of deadlines with no sunset in sight”* or *“your dreams are looping pop-up windows, like your mind can’t log out”*. These double metaphors (skyline + no sunset, pop-up windows + can’t log out) pack a lot of understanding (the never-ending nature of work). Emulate this by ensuring any multi-part image clearly connects and reinforces the emotional message. If an evocation is too minimal at this level, consider adding a second clause that enriches it. If it’s too baroque or confusing, simplify to the core image that resonates most.  
- Continue to use **present tense, second person** to place the client in the metaphor. “You’re climbing…,” “you’re out there in brittle armor…,” “it’s as if…” – this makes the imagery feel immediate and about *them*, which increases its impact.

### Mastery Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Mastery-level evocation client statements might themselves be poetic or heavy with symbolism, as the client is expressing intense emotions in shorthand. However, ensure they remain comprehensible. They could be slightly abstract but should still convey a clear feeling or dilemma. For example: *“Some nights I feel hollow.”* (simple, stark emptiness), or *“I picture myself as a hologram version of the leader they expect – projected, not alive.”* (complex image of self-alienation). These provide powerful hooks for metaphoric responses.  
- The statements can be allowed to be shorter or more figurative at mastery because presumably the therapist is skilled to pick them up. E.g., “My chest feels tight thinking about slowing down” – straightforward physical metaphor ready for expansion (tight like a corset, as in the example response). Or “If I disappeared, it feels like I’d pixelate into the air…”, which already is a vivid image from the client. Such dramatic lines are fine, just ensure they are **coherent and emotionally saturated** (like they are in the data). If any are weak, either sharpen the wording or insert a telling detail. For instance, “Some nights I feel hollow” might stand, but if more context needed: “Some nights I feel hollow, like the inside’s been scooped out” (though that scooped image might come from the therapist side too). The division of labor is: client can give a strong kernel, therapist magnifies it.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Mastery evocations should demonstrate **truly creative empathy** – often using the client’s metaphor as a springboard to deepen it or crafting a new striking image that encapsulates the pain. Aim for responses that a client might later recall because it *hit the nail on the head* emotionally. For example, to the “hologram leader” statement, the therapist replied: *“It’s like your real self watches that hologram perform, longing to step into her own skin.”*. This response is rich: it keeps the hologram idea and adds the client’s “real self” watching and longing – powerfully depicting disconnection and yearning. Strive for that level of attunement and imagery.  
- Use metaphors that capture **emotional truths** that might be hard to say literally. E.g., *“If I disappeared, I’d pixelate without anyone catching the pieces.”* Therapist: *“That image of pixelating away shows how **invisible** and **spent** you feel right now.”*. The therapist echoes “pixelating away” and explicitly names the feelings behind it (“invisible and spent”), tying the metaphor to the emotional reality. In mastery evocations, it’s okay to directly attach an emotion word if it cements the link – as long as it clearly arises from the image or context. Check suggestions to see if adding an emotion word or clarifying phrase could sharpen the impact. Conversely, if a suggestion already has too much explanation and not enough image, re-balance it toward showing not telling.  
  - *Flaw:* Using an image that is jarring or trivializing for such heavy content. At mastery, clients are often at breaking points. A poorly chosen metaphor could alienate them. E.g., if a client feels “hollow,” a flippant metaphor like “like an empty pizza box” would be tone-deaf. Instead, the dataset uses: *“Hollow, like the inside has been scraped out while you’re still expected to shine.”* – a dramatic, almost gruesome image (“scraped out”) paired with the pressure to “shine” (perform). That respects the depth of despair. So ensure metaphors are appropriately weighted (serious and vivid) for mastery-level despair or fear.  
  - *Improved Example:* For “chest tight when slowing down,” the suggestion: *“Almost as if **a corset** cinches around your ribs the moment you imagine pausing.”* is excellent – it uses a specific object (corset) known for tightness and restriction, metaphorically matching the client’s experience of constriction when thinking of rest.  
- In many mastery responses, there’s a blend of metaphor and direct empathic wording. Feel free to incorporate **figurative language plus feeling words**. E.g., *“You can see the island of rest, yet every step toward it feels like the planks give way – **no wonder it’s terrifying** to move.”*. The therapist paints an image (island of rest, collapsing bridge) and then validates the feeling (“no wonder it’s terrifying”). This synergy of evocation and validation is a mark of expertise. Scan each suggestion to see if adding a brief normalizing tag (“of course…,” “no wonder…”) after the image would heighten empathy – but only if it doesn’t overcrowd the line. In the example, it’s done succinctly and effectively.  
- Finally, ensure mastery metaphors **connect deeply with the client’s context or implied narrative**. If the data indicates the client’s life theme (e.g., a leader who can’t rest, a caregiver who feels invisible), align the imagery to that theme (e.g., islands of rest for the leader, snow globe of loneliness for the empty-nest father). The more personalized, the more it will land. If a suggestion feels generic or out of character, refine it to borrow elements from the client’s world mentioned elsewhere (like using “planks give way” for someone who is an engineer or builder, or “lantern” for someone who mentioned light – as in Jonas’s fatherhood case with the fragile lantern). Consistency and relevance make metaphors hit home.

## Process Empathy (Noticing and Inquiring into Immediate Process)  
*Process empathy involves the therapist **observing the client’s nonverbal cues or manner of speaking in the here-and-now** and inviting the client to explore those. The client “statements” here are actually descriptions of client behaviors plus a snippet of speech, serving as markers (e.g. client sighs, looks down while saying “I’m fine”). The therapist responds by **naming the observed behavior and gently probing what’s underneath.***  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client (Process) Statements:**  
- Each statement should clearly describe a **specific observable behavior or physiological cue** in the client, *paired with* what the client is verbally saying or doing at that moment. It needs to read like a little scene in therapy. For example: *“Anna exhales sharply and keeps her eyes on the floor, saying ‘It’s fine.’”*. This gives the therapist two things to notice: a sharp exhale and downcast eyes, contrasted with the words “It’s fine.” That discrepancy is a perfect marker for process empathy.  
- Use **objective, neutral language** to describe behaviors (e.g., “twists her ring with a tight smile,” “foot taps rapidly when talking about X”). Avoid interpreting in the description (not “she’s anxious,” but describe the anxious behavior). The point is to cue what the therapist would literally see or hear.  
- Ensure the described behavior is **relevant and commonly meaningful**. E.g., fidgeting, sighing, avoiding eye contact, changes in tone, etc., are good cues. Make sure it’s plausible: therapists often notice things like a sudden pause, voice softening, tearing up, clenching fists, etc. If a statement is lacking a clear cue, add one. If it describes something too subtle or ambiguous (like “her finger twitches”), consider a more evident one or pair it with context (maybe finger tapping nervously).  
- Pair the behavior with the client’s spoken content for contrast or emphasis. Often the meaningful moment is when behavior and words mismatch (client says “I’m fine” but looks sad, or laughs while describing trauma). Highlight that. If the snippet doesn’t include spoken words, it can, but some process markers might be entirely nonverbal (e.g., a long sigh in silence). Those can work too, but ensure the therapist still has something to comment on (the sigh itself). Basic level often uses simple combos: one behavior + one phrase.  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- The therapist’s response should **explicitly name the observed behavior and invite the client to explore it, in an empathic way**. The structure typically is: *“I notice [behavior cue] as you [repeat client’s content] – [gentle invitation about inner experience].”* For example: *“I notice that big exhale and your eyes dropping as you say it’s fine; what’s happening inside right now?”*. This response models the essential components: *notice* (big exhale, eyes dropping), *contrast* (you say “it’s fine”), and *invite* (“what’s happening inside?”). Ensure each suggestion follows this pattern: Observation + Curious question.  
- Use **tentative, curious language**: “I notice…”, “I’m seeing…”, “Your [X] is really [Y] as you talk about Z – could we check what that’s about?” This keeps it non-judgmental. Avoid any interpretation or labeling like “You’re clearly angry” – instead just point out the cue (“your foot is really going” or “you’re clenching your jaw”) and ask about it (“what’s that part feeling?”).  
  - *Flaw:* Omitting the observation or phrasing it as a fact about the client’s psyche. E.g., “You don’t really think it’s fine, do you?” (This jumps to interpretation and can feel accusatory.) Or just “How do you feel inside?” without reference – too general, missed opportunity to anchor in observed behavior.  
  - *Improved:* “**As you say 'there’s plenty of time,' I’m noticing your eyes going back to the watch – what happens inside as you hold both?**”. This explicitly anchors to behavior (looking at watch) and the contradictory words (“there’s time”), then inquires how it feels to have that split (holding both). This is exemplary process empathy.  
- Keep the focus on the *present moment experience*. Phrases like “right now” or “as you say that” help ground the inquiry in the immediate process. This differentiates from normal content questions and is key to process comments. Ensure suggestions include those time markers or context (e.g., “while describing X,” “when you talk about Y, your voice softens…”).  
- Keep the question **open-ended and gentle**. Often it’s “what’s happening inside?”, “what is that part trying to say?”, or “could we check what’s underneath?” The goal is to give the client space to explore the feeling connected to the behavior. Make sure the suggestion does *not* sound like a challenge (not “Why are you smiling while saying that?” which can sound confrontational). Instead: *“I notice that tight smile as you talk about this – I’m curious what you’re feeling underneath it.”* Empathic, not accusatory. The dataset suggestions are good models, e.g., *“Your foot is really going while we imagine a weekend off – what is that part trying to say right now?”* uses playful language (“your foot is really going”) and then a kind inquiry.  
- Make sure to **validate by tone that noticing the behavior is okay**. The therapist’s phrasing should imply acceptance, not criticism of the behavior. Words like “really going,” “going back to the watch,” “holding tightly,” are neutral descriptions. Avoid loaded words (e.g. “nervously tapping” – just say “tapping” and let the client tell you it’s nervous). The question that follows should also be kind (e.g., asking “does this part feel something?” acknowledges it as a part trying to help or express, which is non-pathologizing).  
- If any suggestion currently *misses either the behavior or the invitation*, adjust accordingly. For example, if the original suggestion only said “You sighed. What’s that mean?” it’s too blunt and not enough context. Expand it: “That sigh came out just now – I wonder what feeling might have been in it?” This identifies the sigh and invites exploration without demanding an answer. Each refined suggestion at basic should look like a therapist gently pointing out something and asking “what’s this about for you?”.

### Intermediate Level  
**Enhancing Client (Process) Statements:**  
- At intermediate, the described scenarios can involve more subtle or multiple cues happening together, or cues during more emotionally charged content. The statements might also illustrate the **client’s avoidance or discomfort more clearly**. For instance: *“He stares at his hands, voice fading to a whisper.”* – two cues (downcast gaze + lowered voice) without an explicit client quote, implying he’s talking about something sensitive. That’s a good marker.  
- You can also include **context of topic** if relevant (“when purpose comes up he begins tracing invisible lines on his notebook”) – it’s helpful for the therapist to know *when* the behavior occurs. But keep it concise; the focus is still the behavior. The key is that by intermediate, the scenarios might layer an action and a change in voice or posture (e.g., shifting in chair *and* giving short answers). Ensure clarity though: don’t pack so many behaviors that it’s confusing. Two related cues at once are fine (e.g., “shifts and answers get brief” – both indicate discomfort).  
- If a statement is too simple or only verbal (“He says softly ‘it’s nothing.’”), consider adding the nonverbal or paralinguistic aspect (“inhales through nose and lets it out slowly before saying ‘It’s nothing.’” – now we have the slow breath as a cue). Conversely, if it lists too many trivial behaviors, pick the most salient. Each should highlight something an intermediate therapist would notice and feel worth exploring (e.g., alignment of notebook perfectly and silence is noteworthy; whereas tapping a pencil *and* shifting *and* blinking might be too much at once unless they co-occur meaningfully).  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- The responses can be slightly more nuanced, possibly **identifying the feeling or part indirectly in the question**. For example: *“Your voice softened to almost a whisper while you studied your hands – what feelings are sitting there?”*. The therapist not only notes voice and gaze, but instead of a generic “what’s happening?”, they specifically ask about “what feelings are sitting there?” which assumes something is “sitting” in the silence. This gentle assumption can help the client go straight to naming feelings. Make sure suggestions at this level still allow the client to fill in the blank (don’t you fill it), but can be a tad more leading towards *emotions*.  
- Therapists may also reflect a hypothesis as part of their inquiry, while keeping it tentative. E.g., *“I notice you shifting and the answers getting brief – does this part of the conversation feel uncomfortable?”*. Here the therapist delicately inserts “does this feel uncomfortable?” – naming a likely feeling (discomfort) that the behavior suggests, framed as a question. Use this technique carefully: only if the feeling is a pretty safe guess and it normalizes (saying “uncomfortable” is empathetic, not accusing). If used, ensure it’s phrased as a **yes/no or tentative question**, so the client can correct if wrong.  
  - *Flaw:* Not linking the behavior to any potential inner state at all, or conversely stating it as fact. E.g., flawed: “You aligned your notebook just so and nodded – you’re avoiding talking.” (Too direct an interpretation and accusatory in tone.)  
  - *Improved:* “**You lined that notebook up just so and nodded in silence – what is the alignment helping with right now?**”. This response notices the precise behavior (aligning notebook, nodding silently) and asks in a very non-judgmental way what that action is *helping with*. This assumes the behavior has a purpose (often to cope or contain feelings) without negative phrasing. It invites the client to reflect on their own avoidance or need in a gentle manner. Strive to frame questions that way for behaviors that look like avoidance or controlling: “what is [behavior] doing for you?” or “what’s [behavior] holding onto right now?” – implying the behavior is an attempt to manage something, which de-shames the exploration.  
- Use **language that externalizes the behavior as a part or ally** rather than a flaw. For example: *“That slow breath came right before you said it’s nothing – what was in the breath that didn’t make it into words?”*. This implies the breath might carry meaning that wasn’t spoken – a very empathic way to view a sigh or breath (the client isn’t just dismissing, something unspoken is there). These sorts of questions reflect advanced empathy. Check suggestions to incorporate similar phrasing: “what was in that pause/smile/sigh…?” or “what were those [tears, clenched fists] trying to say?”  
- Maintain clarity when multiple cues are present: mention both but succinctly. The therapist can combine observations: “I see X and Y” or use one clause per cue. If the current suggestion only mentions one and misses another significant one, add it. E.g., if client both *laughs* and *leans back*, ideally therapist notes both: “You leaned back with that joke about being ‘too extra,’ and then came the sigh – what feeling slipped in with that sigh?” This example shows two sequential cues: joke/lean back, then sigh. The therapist acknowledges the sequence and zooms in on the sigh’s meaning. Structure similarly for others: note the initial behavior and any subsequent telling cue, then inquire.  
- As always, tone should be **curious, not accusatory**. At intermediate, a therapist might be a bit more direct about noticing avoidance (“shifting, brief answers – uncomfortable?”) as shown, but still with kindness and room for the client to respond freely. Ensure no suggestion comes off as scolding (e.g., avoid “Why are you…?” or “You’re clearly…”) – none of the provided do, so follow their model. 

### Mastery Level  
**Enhancing Client (Process) Statements:**  
- Mastery-level process markers may involve *strong emotion breaking through*, or very significant nonverbal gestures that accompany high-stakes moments. The client might be partially aware (e.g., covers face as tears well, or forces a polite smile while shoulders slump). These scenarios combine a clear sign of emotion plus maybe a masking behavior. For example: *“Lars pauses, eyes moist, then shields his face with his hand.”* – a potent moment where vulnerability appears (moist eyes, covering face). Or *“He smiles politely while his shoulders sag.”* – conflict between smile and sagging posture. Such rich moments should be captured in the statements.  
- Include as much context as needed to understand significance, but usually at mastery the behavior itself tells the story (it’s often obvious these are signs of hurt, shame, etc.). Still, you might mention the general topic if relevant (“when talking about retirement, he...”). But brevity is fine if it’s clear: the focus is on the poignant cue.  
- If any mastery statement seems minor, consider heightening it. For instance, not just “he looks away when upset” but maybe “he removes his glasses to polish lenses that are already clean” (a subtle way to hide tears, as in the dataset). That detail (“already clean lenses”) signals that it’s not about cleaning but about managing emotion – exactly the kind of detail to include. Ensure these statements have that level of meaningful detail. The dataset shows many: e.g. “polishing lenses that don’t need it,” “exhales through nose, shoulders dropping, voice barely a whisper” – multiple channels of expression at once.  
- In summary, pick scenarios where the client’s **defenses momentarily drop or emotional leakage happens**, or they do something telling to control themselves (cover face, align things, laugh shakily, etc.). These are prime mastery markers.

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Mastery responses combine keen observation with an even more nuanced invitation or sometimes a very gentle challenge to stay with the emotion. They might incorporate a bit of **grounding or reassurance** alongside the inquiry if the client is really on the edge. For example: *“I saw a pause with some moisture in your eyes before you covered your face – what was moving through in that pause?”*. This response is delicate: it acknowledges the almost-tears (“moisture in your eyes”) and the covering of face, and asks about the *moment before the cover* (i.e., what the feeling was). It focuses the client on the emotion that was starting, implicitly encouraging them not to hide again. That’s expert-level process empathy and gentle challenge to stay with feeling. Ensure suggestions similarly focus on the feeling trying to emerge, using the behavior as context.  
- The therapist might also **contrast the polite mask vs true emotion** in the inquiry. E.g.: *“There’s that courteous smile and I also see the weight in your shoulders – can we check in with that heaviness?”*. This response explicitly names the two contradictory signals (smile vs sagging shoulders) and chooses to inquire about the heavier one (“that heaviness”). This both normalizes the polite act and invites deeper exploration. For any mastery suggestion where the client is putting on a front, use this approach: mention the front *and* the underlying cue, then ask about the underlying. This validates the facade (courteous smile) as not going unnoticed, but shows interest in the pain beneath (heavy shoulders).  
  - *Flaw:* Not addressing the deeper emotion or being too timid when strong signals are present. For instance, if a client’s voice shakes and tears are visible, a weak response might be: “You’re getting emotional, sorry.” or quickly giving tissues (non-verbal response). Instead, an expert would gently bring attention to it verbally.  
  - *Improved:* “**Your hand settled on your chest and the breath slowed – what is your heart wanting to say right now?**”. This example notices a self-soothing gesture (hand on chest) and slower breathing (calming), then directly asks about the heart’s message – attributing voice to the emotion (heart). It’s an artful way to encourage expression of a vulnerable feeling in the moment.  
- Mastery inquiries can also incorporate **support to help the client stay**, almost like mini-interventions within the question. For example, if the client looks like they might dissociate or freeze, the therapist might say, *“I notice [behavior]; I’m right here. Feel the chair with me… what does that part need right now?”*. The dataset indeed shows advanced interventions in process: e.g., *“Let’s feel your weight in the chair. One word for that ghost feeling while I’m with you.”* – combining grounding (chair, one word) with empathy. But those appear to be in the *staying-with-intense-affect* category, not process-empathy. Still, if a process moment is very intense (like near tears, covering face), a hint of reassurance in the phrasing (“I’m here” or softer tone implied) is good. The suggestions given mostly focus on inquiry but with very warm language (“gentle”, “I see”, “can we… together”).  
- Use **inclusive language or teaming** if appropriate: e.g., “Can we check…”, “shall we see… together.” At mastery, the therapist often positions as an ally in exploring the client’s process. The dataset’s process responses often still say “I notice…” then “what’s happening…?” But you could add “with that heaviness” or “while I’m with you” to emphasize collaboration. For instance: *“I notice your eyes shining as you polish lenses that don’t need it – what’s the polishing helping you hold?”*. This example doesn’t explicitly say “we,” but the phrasing “helping you hold” implies the therapist sees the behavior as something that helps the client cope. Such framing is compassionate and expertly done. So ensure responses portray the behavior as meaningful (helping/doing something, not just odd).  
- Double-check the **precision of observation language** at this level. If the client has “eyes shining” (perhaps with tears), say that rather than a generic “you look sad.” If they “exhale softly, shoulders dropping,” describe it exactly. Master therapists notice fine details and use them therapeutically. All given suggestions do this well (moist eyes, polite smile, hand on chest, etc.). Emulate that by keeping any descriptive part specific and grounded in what an outside observer sees/hears (not “you are sad” but “I see tears gathering” or “your voice caught”).  
- Overall, mastery process empathy responses should convey a sense of **“I see the real feeling even as you try to hide it, and it’s welcome here.”** They do this by pointing out the hiding (covering face, polite smile) in a non-shaming way, and explicitly welcoming the hidden feeling (“heaviness,” “what your heart wants to say”). Ensure each suggestion does that: notice, normalize, invite the deeper feeling to have space.

## Empathic Refocusing (Gently Redirecting to Feelings from Content)  
*In empathic refocusing, the therapist honors the client’s wish to shift away from painful feelings (often toward practical topics or deflections) **but** invites them to briefly return to the emotion so it’s not entirely avoided. The client statements usually show the client steering away from emotion (“let’s talk about something else, not this feeling”). The therapist responds by acknowledging the other topic’s importance **and** asking to stay a moment with the emotion.*  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Client statements should clearly depict **avoidance or deflection**. Typically, the client explicitly says they’d rather not go into an emotion and would prefer a safer, more cognitive topic. For example: *“Let's discuss the firm's new project; that's more productive.”*. Or *“No need to go on about retirement nerves; they'll pass.”*. These straightforwardly show the client steering away (“let’s not dwell,” “I’d rather do X instead of feeling Y”). Ensure each statement contains that structure: reference to an *emotional topic* (“crash after the sparkle,” “emptiness,” “my ache”) that they want to skip, and a *preferred topic or action* (logistics, productive talk, planning).  
- Keep the tone consistent with someone who is uncomfortable with feelings: maybe a bit dismissive or minimizing (“I’m just being dramatic, let’s skip it”). But don’t make them hostile; they are just defending. Many examples have the client rationalizing or belittling the emotion (“feels melodramatic, let’s skip it”). This is good – it sets up the intervention. So add words like “melodramatic,” “no sense dampening [others’ joy] with my fog,” etc., to capture how the client judges the emotional discussion.  
- Ensure the *emotion or issue being avoided is named* in passing, so the therapist knows what to refocus on. E.g., in “Let's stay on high points, I don't want to feel the crash,” the “crash after the sparkle” is named. This is important: the therapist will refocus on that “crash” emotion. If a statement just says “I don’t want to talk about that,” try to include a hint of what “that” is (“I don't want to feel the sadness – let's talk about work”).  
- Basic-level might include simpler avoidance statements, but still identifiable as avoidance. For example: “Talk me through studio logistics instead of this emptiness.”. The client literally contrasts “logistics” with “this emptiness” – perfect. If any client line is just “Let’s do practical” without naming feeling, consider adding “instead of [feeling].”  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- The therapist’s refocusing response should **validate the client’s preference AND request a brief return to the feeling** – a delicate balance. The general format: Acknowledge the content or coping (“We can/We will [do content]…” or “The [other topic] is important/understandable”) **then** gently propose spending a short, tolerable time with the feeling (“could we first… just for a moment, so it doesn’t X?”). For example: *“The project is important, **and** I noticed we stepped away from how adrift you feel. Would it be okay to touch that feeling briefly **before** we dive into plans?”*. This clearly does: affirms project as important, uses “and” (not “but”), notes the avoided feeling (“adrift”), asks to touch it briefly first. Aim for this structure in all refocusing suggestions.  
- Keep the **tone collaborative and optional**: use phrases like “would it be okay,” “maybe we could,” “how about we just… and then…” – giving the client agency. Emphasize **brevity** and **safety** in the request: e.g. “for a moment,” “briefly,” “just a little so it doesn’t blindside you later,” etc. This helps the client feel it’s manageable. Many provided examples do: “visit it briefly so it doesn’t blindside you later”, “give it a gentle nod before we sketch”. These imply a very short check-in with the feeling *with a rationale* (so it doesn’t blindside, so it doesn’t quietly take over, etc.). That rationale frames the feeling exploration as useful, not indulgent – which appeals to avoidant clients. Include such rationale if possible, tailored to the situation (e.g., acknowledging emptiness prevents it from taking over, honoring ache might inform the mentoring topics, etc.).  
  - *Flaw:* Failing to acknowledge the client’s request or pushing emotion in a way that feels like a disregard of their boundary. E.g., client: “Let’s not dwell on it.” Flawed therapist: “No, we need to talk about your sadness.” (Too blunt, ignoring their wish.) Or ignoring the avoidance entirely and switching topics (giving in fully, which is a missed intervention).  
  - *Improved:* Always start by **joining** with the client’s agenda somewhat: e.g., “We’ll cover logistics” or “The shed matters” or “Blueprints are familiar territory”, etc. This alignment reduces client defensiveness. Then use a gentle “perhaps” or “maybe” to propose the feeling focus: “Perhaps we share that fog for a moment so it’s easier to look at the specs after.” – note the cause-effect (it’ll be easier after if we do this). Always include the **promised return** to the client’s topic (“before we dive into plans,” “then we’ll plan,” “then we’ll shift,” etc.). This assures the client you’re not derailing their needs, just pausing.  
- Use **metaphor or imagery** if the client’s avoidance statement had any. Many examples incorporate the client’s terms: “high points” vs “crash,” “sparkle” vs “crash,” “fog,” “emptiness,” “ache.” The therapist often reflects those: “the high points are fun, and the crash has something to say too” or “your fog gets a little voice so you both get to show up”. This is empathic and keeps the conversation in the client’s own metaphorical world. So ensure suggestions reuse the client’s key words for the feeling or avoidance. If the client said “ache,” therapist should say “the ache.” If “emptiness,” therapist mentions “the emptiness.” It shows you’re not introducing something new, just pointing to what they named.  
- Keep the **two-part structure balanced**: roughly one sentence acknowledging, one sentence refocusing. E.g., “Mentoring topics are valuable. Maybe if we sit with the ache for a moment, those topics will come from a fuller place.”. First short sentence validates the avoidance (mentoring topics *are* valuable), second introduces the value of feeling (ache gives fuller context). This is an ideal formula. If a suggestion is too one-sided, adjust. For example, if it only says “Could we feel X first?” add a prior clause “Yes, we can do Y.” If it only reassures but doesn’t actually refocus, add the ask.  
- The **wording should be gentle and positive** about the emotion. Instead of framing the feeling as something to “confront” or “dwell on,” frame it as to “acknowledge,” “honor,” “give a nod,” “listen to,” “share,” etc., **for a limited time** (“a single breath,” “two seconds,” “briefly”). The dataset does this: “maybe we give it a gentle nod”, “open the door for a moment”, “hold it together for a moment”, etc. Use those kind of phrases. Avoid anything that sounds like you’ll “get into it deeply” which the client fears. The goal is to make it non-threatening.  
- Consider also highlighting the benefit of doing so, as many examples do implicitly or explicitly: e.g., “so it doesn’t feel shamed into silence”, “so it doesn’t quietly take over”. This gives the logical/rational justification the avoidant part might need to comply. Try to include such a rationale if space allows and it flows. It often starts with “so…” or “that way…”. If not present, think what the client might gain (e.g., not being blindsided by suppressed feelings, making sure both parts are addressed, ensuring the plan is informed by true feelings, etc.) and incorporate it briefly. This final touch can show an AI how to complete the empathic logic.  

### Intermediate Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Intermediate avoidance statements can be slightly more nuanced or internal, perhaps expressing a fear if they *do* engage the emotion. For example: *“If I lean into longing I might not get back to work – keep me focused.”*. Here the client directly voices a fear of being overwhelmed by feeling (not returning to work) and thus pleads to stay focused. Such statements are great: they include a conditional (“if I feel, X bad will happen”) and a request. Ensure some statements have this form, as it allows the therapist to address the fear.  
- They might also bring in concerns about others: e.g., “Travel itineraries are safer than feelings – let’s stay there.” is still straightforward, but intermediate could mention why (like “I prefer to plan because feelings are too messy”). Still, clarity is key; don't get too wordy.  
- Keep including the emotional content that’s being avoided, possibly with more explicit mention of what they fear (like being *melodramatic* or *losing momentum*, etc.). E.g., “Discussing loss of purpose feels melodramatic; let's skip it.” or “If I admit the spark is dimming I’ll feel useless – let’s not go there.”. These reveal the *anticipated negative feeling or judgment* if they talk about it (“I’ll feel useless”), which is a rich setup for therapist to validate and refocus. So such statements are good to include. They show more self-awareness of what's scary about the feeling, which is fitting for intermediate difficulty.  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- At intermediate, therapist responses can more directly address the **fear or belief the client voiced** while still encouraging a brief emotional focus. For instance, to “I might not get back to work if I feel longing,” therapist: *“I hear how important work is. **Perhaps we can honor that longing briefly so it doesn’t pull at you while you’re trying to focus.**”*. This response first validates work’s importance (so the client knows they won’t sabotage it), then suggests acknowledging longing for a bit **so that** it won’t subconsciously interfere. This directly addresses the fear (longing derailing work) by reframing that *checking the feeling will actually help you focus*. That’s a more advanced, persuasive strategy. Ensure suggestions do similar when the client expresses a worry: respond in a way that alleviates that worry (e.g., if client fears being useless, maybe “holding that fear together for a minute so it feels less overwhelming” – shows facing it a little will reduce its power).  
- Therapists can be slightly more **explicit or firm** in empathy that the feeling needs attention (still gentle overall). They might say “keeps tapping” or note “the question of meaning keeps tapping though – can we open the door for a moment…?” This implies the emotion is persistently there (“keeps tapping”) and invites giving it a moment. Use such imagery or personification (“keeps tapping,” “keeps tugging”) to convey that the feeling won’t disappear by ignoring. It’s empathic pressure. If not present in a suggestion, consider if adding it fits: e.g., “I’m also hearing a part of you that’s uneasy – could we listen to it briefly…?”. That example mentions the uneasy part is *heard*, thus it’s not going away by planning alone.  
- The **acknowledgment part** can be more nuanced as well: not just “we will cover X,” but possibly recognizing why X feels safer: “Blueprints are familiar territory”, “Planning trips is tangible”. These show deeper understanding of the client’s avoidance (familiar, tangible vs emotion’s uncertainty). Include such insight if appropriate. It validates not just the topic but the reason the client wants it. This level of validation can make the client more willing to trust the therapist’s guidance.  
- Continue using **time-bound and choice-oriented language**. Perhaps slightly less tentative than basic if the alliance is strong, but still respectful: “Perhaps we can…,” “maybe just one breath with X then…,” etc. None of these are demands. For example: “Could we invite it in gently so it doesn’t have to vanish?” referencing a part that disappears – implying giving it space will keep it from vanishing (which the client unconsciously might want too). Always highlight *togetherness* and *control*: “you can stop anytime,” or “then we’ll shift” are implied or stated in many responses. Ensure none of the suggestions omit the promise to return to safety (client’s preferred topic or stopping if too much).  
- Possibly integrate **client’s own words of concern** into the reassurance. E.g., if they said “melodramatic,” therapist: *“It can feel melodramatic, absolutely. I’d still like to sit with that part of you that questions purpose, just so it doesn’t feel shamed into silence.”*. This uses “melodramatic” (to acknowledge feeling) and directly counters the shame (“doesn’t feel shamed”). It’s very validating and refocusing. Do similar: if client says “I’ll feel useless,” therapist might incorporate “that fear of feeling useless is painful… maybe we hold it together briefly so it’s less overwhelming.” The idea is to loop the client’s fear into the plan as something to soothe by briefly feeling.  
- Ensure no response outright ignores the client’s content request. The structure must always have that initial clause aligning with the client, especially at intermediate where the client is on guard for being ignored. Every example does it; make sure none of your suggestions dropped it. If any did, prepend a validating phrase.  
- Master the **“and” or “... . Could we ... first, then ...”** sentence structures. They effectively join rather than oppose. Using “and” instead of “but” is critical (as shown in examples). The format "We will do X, and could we do Y for a moment first?" should be consistent. If any suggestion has “but,” swap it for “and” or restructure to avoid implying a trade-off. We want to convey *we’ll do both*, not one at expense of the other.  

### Mastery Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Mastery avoidance statements are often deeply rooted in identity or relationship concerns. They might reveal a *part of them wants to avoid because showing the feeling threatens their self-concept or another person’s happiness.* For example: *“Inger is excited – no sense dampening it with my fog.”* – the client doesn’t want to bring spouse down. Or *“If I admit the spark is dimming, I’ll feel useless – let’s not go there.”* – core worth threat. These statements are rich: they show exactly why the client avoids (to not burden others, to not feel worthless). Make sure such facets are present in mastery examples.  
- They also might demonstrate a bit of insight, like *“Part of me wants to disappear when we talk about retirement.”* – client acknowledges a part, but still likely avoiding fully exploring it. Or *“I’d rather describe wood grain than stay with how lost I feel.”* – which clearly states the emotion (“lost”) but chooses a distraction (wood grain details) over it. These are excellent because the emotion is very clear. Ensure mastery lines name that vulnerable feeling (“lost,” “terrified,” etc.) that is being avoided or minimized (“feels melodramatic,” “I’ll feel useless,” “I’d rather not because X”). This gives the therapist maximum handle to respond.  
- Mastery statements might also be shorter if context is known, but usually still contain the duality. Possibly more metaphorical or polished because the client may articulate well (“feels melodramatic” is quite meta about their own feeling). That’s fine; just ensure the avoidant stance is obvious.  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Mastery refocusing responses should show **high attunement to the client’s values and fears**, and use that attunement to encourage a brief emotional focus as a path to relief or integrity. For instance, if the client doesn’t want to dampen Inger’s excitement with his fog, the therapist: *“You care so much about her joy. Maybe we can give your fog a little voice so you both get to show up in this conversation.”*. This response expertly: (1) Validates his value (her joy), (2) reframes giving his feeling a voice as allowing both partners to be present (rather than him overshadowing her). It doesn’t directly say “so you don’t dampen,” but implies a balanced outcome. Aim for such creativity: essentially turning the client’s fear on its head – showing that acknowledging the feeling in a small way actually honors both parties.  
- When a client has a core identity worry (“I’ll feel useless”), the therapist should convey deep empathy and also gentle challenge. E.g., *“Feeling useless is painful. Maybe we can hold that fear together for a minute so it feels less overwhelming.”*. This goes further than earlier levels: it directly labels the avoided feeling (“feeling useless”) as painful (empathic validation), then suggests jointly holding it (so the client isn’t alone with it) briefly to reduce its power. It addresses the emotional need (not to be alone in feeling worthless) while nudging toward experiencing it a bit. Use this pattern for big fears: acknowledge and offer to co-hold.  
- With parts like “part of me wants to disappear,” response: *“That disappearing part has something important to say. Could we invite it in gently so it doesn’t have to vanish?”*. This is advanced – it personifies the part, implies it’s vanishing because it’s not heard, and suggests giving it space will keep it from literally “disappearing” (which mirrors the client’s phrasing). The therapist conveys: I see even your avoidance (disappearing part) as important and we can welcome it safely. Ensure mastery responses treat such extreme statements with that level of respect and curiosity.  
- Mastery refocusing often explicitly states **assurance** that engaging the feeling will not ruin things. E.g., *“It makes sense to feel that way, and I’d still like to sit with it so it doesn’t stay shamed/overwhelming/etc.”* The provided examples embed assurance: “just so it doesn’t feel shamed into silence,” “so it feels less overwhelming,” etc. Always tie back to the benefit: the feeling will be **less** of a problem if we attend to it briefly, not more. This directly tackles the client’s worst expectation (e.g., “I’ll be overwhelmed” – therapist implies “actually you’ll be *less* overwhelmed if we do this a bit”). That’s a powerful reframe and a selling point for the client’s logical side. If any suggestion is missing that when there was a clear fear, add it.  
- Language wise, remain **collaborative and gentle**. Possibly at mastery a therapist might be slightly more confident (“I’d still like to” as opposed to “maybe we could”), but should still phrase as an invitation, not demand. The examples do sometimes say “I’d like to” or “I want to” (alliance statements showing therapist’s caring intention) combined with a question or permission phrase. That’s fine to emulate: “I’d like to… would that be okay?” shows investment + respect. For instance: “I won’t rush you to an answer” in the self-disclosure category demonstrates gentle promise. In refocusing, they often choose maybe/ perhaps phrasing still. Use whatever is shown or seems consistent.  
- Continue to use the client’s own language (melodramatic, fog, spark, etc.) in your response; it shows you’re with them. And always double-acknowledge: their perspective and the feeling’s importance. E.g., *“It can feel melodramatic, absolutely. I’d still like to sit with that part…”* acknowledges yes it feels melodramatic (so client feels heard) before inviting anyway. That two-prong approach should be present in all mastery suggestions.  
- Ensure suggestions are succinct but packed with empathy. The dataset’s mastery lines usually fit in one or two sentences, no more. They don’t lecture. They just hit the key points elegantly. Strive for that economy: too wordy and the client might tune out. For training AI, showing it in concise form is ideal. 

## Alliance Repair (Responding to Ruptures or Client Negative Feedback)  
*Alliance repair scenarios involve the client expressing hurt, frustration or feeling misunderstood by something the therapist did or said (a rupture marker). The therapist response must model taking responsibility, empathizing with the client’s feeling, and inviting continued dialogue to fix the relationship.*  

### Basic Level  
**Enhancing Client Statements:**  
- Client statements should clearly describe **what the therapist did that upset them and how it made them feel**, in a straightforward manner. Use first-person from client and directly quote or paraphrase the therapist’s misstep if possible. For example: *“When you said 'lots of people are tired,' I felt unseen.”*. This specifies the therapist’s comment and the emotional impact (“felt unseen”). These concrete formulations (When you did X, I felt Y) are perfect markers. Ensure each has that form: “When you [action or quote], I felt [hurt/ignored/pressured/etc].”  
- Keep them short and focused on one issue at a time for basic level. Also ensure the feeling is something fundamental like “unseen,” “brushed off,” “hurt,” “pressure,” etc., which a therapist can easily recognize as a rupture feeling. If a draft lacks an explicit feeling word, add one (“I felt dismissed/criticized/etc.”) so the therapist knows what to address.  
- Keep the tone as the client being honest but not attacking. The examples are polite but firm (“I felt brushed off when you told me to 'take a breath' instead of hearing the panic.” – clear and direct). Avoid extreme blaming or insults; in training scenarios, clients usually voice dissatisfaction calmly to allow repair (though they are upset). The given ones do exactly that. So emulate: a bit vulnerable (“I felt…”) rather than “You screwed up.”  

**Upgrading Therapist Responses:**  
- Therapist responses must model **apology, validation of the client’s perspective, and willingness to fix** in one. Typically: Start with thanking or appreciating the feedback (if appropriate), a sincere apology or ownership of mistake, an empathic validation of the client’s feeling, and an explicit invitation to correct course (“let’s slow down,” “what would help now?” etc.). For example: *“Thank you for telling me that – it sounds like I minimized how intense this is for you. I’m sorry, and I want to really get it now. What would help us stay with it here?”*. In this one: they appreciate (“thank you for telling me”), acknowledge mistake (“I minimized… this is on me”), apologize (“I’m sorry”), express desire to do better (“I want to really get it now”), and then ask how to proceed (“what would help us stay with it?”). That’s excellent. Ensure suggestions include these elements in a natural flow.  
- Use **first person singular** to take responsibility (e.g., “I rushed ahead,” “I skipped over…,” “my comment landed like pressure…”). The dataset does: “I hear that – and I notice I did feel hurried. I’m sorry”, “my comment landed like pressure to perform. I’m sorry”, “I can hear that I rushed ahead”, “I skipped over the panic”. For each client gripe, have the therapist acknowledge it specifically. If a suggestion omitted specifying the misstep, add it (“I did XYZ…”).  
- Provide **empathic understanding of the client’s feeling** as part of the repair. E.g., “You’re right – that quick reminder skipped over the panic you were naming” which validates the client’s experience that the therapist missed something. Or “I can hear that I rushed ahead” acknowledges the effect. If a suggestion lacks that or phrases it weakly, strengthen it: e.g., not just “I’m sorry I did that,” but also “it sounds like that made you feel X, which makes sense.” (Though often acknowledging the action itself suffices if the feeling is obvious).  
- Include an **invitation to continue** or a collaborative fix. Many responses end with a question or suggestion on how to proceed: “Would it help to pick up right where you left off?”, “What would feel supportive instead?”, “can we go back to what the panic needs me to understand?”. This shows the therapist wants to repair by doing things differently *now*, not just apologizing. Ensure each suggestion has something along those lines – either asking the client for guidance or proposing a redo (“let’s slow down now,” “let’s center your experience now,” etc.). If it’s missing, add a question like “what would be most helpful for me to do now?” or a statement like “I want to make sure we [client’s unmet need]. Shall we [specific suggestion]?”  
  - *Flaw:* If a suggestion only says “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that” and stops, it’s incomplete. Or if it defends (“I was just trying to help” – absolutely no). Another flaw: focusing too much on the therapist’s intention (“I meant well”) – avoid that. The focus should be on the client’s experience and moving forward. If any hint of justification is present, remove it. For training, model pure accountability.  
  - *Improved:* Always pivot quickly to client’s feelings and next steps. E.g., “I see I did that, I’m sorry – I want to hear the rest of what you were trying to say. Can we go back to that?” This kind of response is humble and client-centered.  
- Tone: **humble, caring, not defensive**. Use “I’m sorry” or even “I apologize” (though “I’m sorry” is more human-sounding). Possibly “thank you” for feedback as appropriate (especially if client’s tone is not hostile, which in these scenarios it isn’t). That shows appreciation for trust. Each provided response at basic has either “Thank you for naming that” or at least a straightforward apology + acknowledgement.  
- Use “and” to join apology with plan: “I’m sorry, **and** I want to slow down here…” (the examples do that frequently). That signals you can do both: apologize and correct, instead of just dwelling on the mistake.  
- Optionally, if it fits, validate the *content* of the client’s message beyond the process. For instance, in one example therapist says “it sounds like I minimized how intense this is for you” – that’s acknowledging content (intensity of client’s experience) that was missed. Another: “my comment landed like pressure to perform” acknowledges that indeed it might have felt like the therapist expected performance. These show the therapist truly *gets why* the client was upset. Try to include something like that – basically rephrasing the complaint in validating language. Not just “I did X,” but “I see it made you feel Y because of Z.” Keep it concise though.  
- Summarily, every alliance repair response should contain: **ownership (I did/said X), apology, validation (“you felt X and that makes sense”), commitment to do differently (“I want to… / will not do Y”), and invitation (“help me understand / let’s fix by doing Z / what do you need now?”)**. The style is warm and inviting. The dataset’s lines hit these nicely; ensure yours do too in a structured yet natural way.
