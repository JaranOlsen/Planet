Primary, Secondary, and Maladaptive Emotions in EFT

Primary Adaptive Emotions: In Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT), primary adaptive emotions are the initial, authentic emotional responses that align with the current situation and help us meet our needs ￼. These are often healthy, instinctive reactions – for example, feeling fear when there is real danger or sadness in response to a loss. Such emotions act like an emotional compass, providing information about what is important and motivating effective action (e.g. fear motivates self-protection, sadness motivates seeking comfort) ￼ ￼. Primary adaptive emotions feel “fresh” and fitting to the moment, and when expressed, they tend to move a person toward growth or relief rather than being stuck. In EFT, therapists aim to help clients access these adaptive feelings because they carry useful messages and can drive positive change.

Primary Maladaptive Emotions: Not all gut-level emotions are helpful in the present; some are primary maladaptive emotions, which are intense, often old feelings that were learned from past painful experiences ￼ ￼. These are immediate emotional reactions too, but they aren’t beneficial now – they reflect unresolved emotional wounds or unmet needs from the past. For example, a person might feel overwhelming shame or despair (core emotional pain) in a current situation that unconsciously triggers a past trauma or loss ￼ ￼. These maladaptive emotions are considered “core pain” in EFT – deeply felt hurt, shame, fear, or loneliness that originated in earlier experiences where the person’s emotional needs were not met. Primary maladaptive emotions tend to be repetitive, familiar, and stuck feelings that do not help the person cope constructively with the present ￼ ￼. EFT theory holds that simply understanding these feelings is not enough; they need to be actively accessed and transformed by having new emotional experiences. Therapists therefore validate and explore a client’s core pain and gently guide them to transform it by evoking different, adaptive emotions (for instance, transforming shame by accessing healthy anger or self-compassion) ￼ ￼. The ultimate goal is to replace the maladaptive feeling with a more adaptive one that can resolve the underlying need.

Secondary Emotional Reactions: Secondary emotions are reactions to our reactions – in other words, feelings we have about our own feelings ￼. They often arise to cover up or avoid primary emotions. Common secondary responses include anger that masks hurt, anxiety about feeling sadness, or shame about feeling anger. For example, instead of showing vulnerability or fear, a person might get angry at themselves or others, or someone feeling hurt might laugh it off or criticize their own sensitivity. These secondary emotions are frequently learned defenses (shaped by family or culture) that kick in automatically to protect us from more raw, tender feelings ￼ ￼. However, secondary reactions usually obscure the true problem. They can become looping, habitual responses (e.g. getting angry whenever one feels threatened, or feeling guilty right after feeling angry) that keep a person from understanding what they really feel deep down ￼ ￼. In EFT, therapists recognize secondary emotions as signals that a primary emotion is underneath. The therapist will validate the secondary feeling (to create safety and reduce any shame about it) and then gently help the client turn attention to the underlying primary emotions that need processing ￼ ￼. By moving past the secondary layer, the client can get to the heart of their experience – whether it’s a core fear, sadness, or shame that really needs care and transformation.

(Note: EFT also distinguishes instrumental emotions, which are strategic or surface emotions shown to get a reaction from others, but these are less central to personal healing. The focus in therapy is usually on the genuine primary and secondary emotions described above.)*

Core Pain and Unmet Emotional Needs

EFT uses the term “core pain” to describe the deep, often long-standing emotional hurts that lie at the center of a client’s struggles. Core pain usually stems from early experiences where crucial emotional needs were not fulfilled – for instance, a need for safety, acceptance, nurturing, or love that went unmet. This leaves an emotional wound, such as profound shame, loneliness, worthlessness, or fear of abandonment, that can be triggered in present life ￼. Core pain is essentially the primary maladaptive emotion discussed above – an emotion that was an honest reaction to past injury (e.g. a child feeling worthless when repeatedly criticized), but that now gets reactivated inappropriately and causes suffering. Clients often go to great lengths to avoid or numb these painful feelings because they are so distressing. Unfortunately, avoiding core pain means the underlying unmet needs remain unaddressed.

Unmet emotional needs are the key desires or longings that were not satisfied in those past situations. For example, a child who felt unloved and developed a core pain of loneliness had an unmet need for love and security; someone who carries shame from childhood bullying had an unmet need for acceptance and respect. In EFT, identifying the unmet need is crucial because it points toward what healing experience is required. The therapist listens for markers of core pain – moments when a client’s voice, posture or words indicate a deep hurt is activated (such as a quiver in the voice when talking about a parent, or statements like “I’ll always be alone”). This marker signals an opportunity to delve into that painful feeling and discover the need embedded in it (e.g. “I needed to be cared for,” “I needed to know I mattered”). Therapists often reflect the need explicitly once it emerges, using phrases like, “It sounds like a part of you really needed protection back then.”

Processing core pain in EFT involves accessing it safely, validating it, and then transforming it by fulfilling the unmet need in some way. First, the therapist’s empathic attunement helps the client allow the painful emotion to surface (in a safe, controlled manner) rather than suppress it. The client might, for instance, vividly express sadness or anger toward an image of an abusive figure in an empty-chair exercise – fully feeling and voicing the core pain of being hurt or abandoned. The therapist guides the client to articulate the unmet need at the heart of that pain: for example, the client might say to the imagined offender, “I was so hurt – I needed you to love me,” or “I needed to be protected.” This clear expression of need is a pivotal moment in EFT ￼ ￼.

Next comes transforming the pain by helping the client experience something that addresses that need. This often means accessing a new adaptive emotion in session. For instance, the client who feels worthless might, with the therapist’s support, mobilize assertive anger to say “I deserved to be treated better – what happened to me was wrong!” (asserting a right to be respected). This is an example of an adaptive emotional response (empowering anger) arising to meet an unmet need (the need for respect and boundaries). Another example is a client flooded with shame and sadness beginning to feel self-compassion as they realize, “I didn’t deserve that abuse – I was just a child,” thus meeting the need for empathy and understanding from themselves ￼. The therapist might facilitate this by gently encouraging the client to direct comfort to their hurt inner part, or by providing a nurturing, accepting response in the therapy relationship to model what was missing. By pairing the old painful emotion with a new healing emotion or experience, the memory is reconsolidated – the brain updates its emotional learning. In practice, clients often report a palpable sense of relief or empowerment after these moments: the core pain loses its grip because the underlying need has finally been acknowledged and answered in some form. Over time, this leads to lasting change, as the client no longer feels stuck in the same loop of hurt and desperate longing; they develop a new, healthier emotional schema where their fundamental needs feel more met or protected.

Levels of Emotional Experiencing and Arousal Regulation

Levels of Emotional Experiencing: EFT places great emphasis on how deeply a client is in contact with their emotions. Not all emotional talk is equal – a client can talk about feelings intellectually or, at the other extreme, be immersed in a profound emotional moment. Therapists are mindful of the levels of emotional experiencing, often drawing on the concept of the Experiencing Scale (which ranges from very surface-level to very deep engagement in one’s internal experience) ￼. At the lower levels (levels 1–3), clients are distant from their feelings – they might be describing events, speaking analytically, or referring to feelings in a very detached way without truly feeling them ￼. For example, a client at a low experiencing level may say, “I guess I was upset,” with a calm voice and no emotional resonance; they are talking about the emotion, not from within it. In this state, therapeutic change is limited because the core emotions remain unaccessed.

As therapy progresses, the goal is to help clients move to deeper levels of experiencing, where they are actively in touch with their felt sense in the moment. A moderate level (around level 4) is considered the minimum for meaningful emotional processing – here the client is presently feeling something and can reflect on it at the same time ￼. For instance, a client might close their eyes, sense a lump in their throat, and say, “I’m noticing a heaviness in my chest as I talk about this loss.” They are in contact with the feeling and exploring it. At even higher levels (5–7), new emotional material emerges and shifts occur: the client might experience a surge of grief or a wave of compassion that was previously implicit, leading to an “aha” moment or a release ￼ ￼. It is at these deep levels of experiencing that transformative emotional events (sometimes called corrective emotional experiences) happen ￼. For example, a client fully engages in a memory of being left out as a child, feels the raw loneliness (level 5), then suddenly connects it to a broader pattern and experiences a profound self-compassion or a need for connection (level 6), and finally comes to a new resolution like “I’m worthy of love” (level 7 insight/new meaning). EFT therapists thus gently guide clients toward these deeper levels, because feeling an emotion fully and safely is what ultimately allows it to shift. If a client stays only at a cognitive or shallow level, the therapy may feel “stuck,” so the therapist will use techniques (like focusing, imagery, evocative questions) to help the client sink down into the more vulnerable feelings at the core.

Arousal Regulation: While deep emotional experiencing is the aim, EFT also stresses that emotional arousal must be kept in an optimal zone for processing – not too little, but not so much that the client is overwhelmed. This balance is often referred to as working within the client’s Window of Tolerance. If a client’s emotional intensity is too low (flat or distant), they may not fully engage with the therapy process; if it’s too high (flooded with emotion), they may feel unsafe or chaotic. EFT therapists are constantly monitoring and regulating emotional arousal in session ￼ ￼. This means the therapist will up-regulate or heighten emotion when the client is very defended or disconnected, and down-regulate or contain emotion when the client is losing control or dissociating.

For example, if a client is describing a painful event in a flat, matter-of-fact tone (low arousal, low experiencing), the therapist might gently evoke more feeling by asking, “As you talk about this, what are you feeling in your body right now?” or by using vivid language: “It sounds like a part of you was very hurt – almost like a little child who felt abandoned.” Such empathic evocations can bring the emotion into the room a bit more strongly. This careful intensification helps the client move from talking about the emotion to actually feeling it. On the other hand, if a client is overwhelmed – say they suddenly burst into sobbing or panic – the EFT therapist will respond by grounding and soothing: speaking in a calm, steady voice, perhaps suggesting the client take a breath, and validating their feelings (“It’s okay, I’m right here with you; you’re feeling a huge wave of grief right now, and that makes sense”). The therapist may slow the process down, for instance by asking the client to put the emotion into words or focusing on a single aspect, which can prevent the client from being swept away. This titration of emotional exposure ensures that the client stays present and engaged with their emotions without becoming retraumatized or shutting down ￼.

In practice, EFT therapists “track the flow” of a client’s arousal closely. They provide a secure anchor for intense emotions (through empathic presence and reassurance) so that even very powerful feelings like rage, terror, or shame can be approached gradually and released without overwhelming the client ￼. If a client starts intellectualizing or cracking jokes (signs of avoiding emotion), the therapist might empathically refocus them back to the feeling (“I notice we drifted into humor – maybe because this is hard to touch. Let’s gently see what feeling was coming up right before we switched gears”). Conversely, if a client is verging on panic, the therapist might interject, “Let’s pause for a moment – I know this is very intense. I want to make sure a part of you knows you are safe here in this room, with me. Maybe feel your feet on the ground as we keep going.” By regulating arousal, EFT therapists maintain a therapeutic sweet spot: the client is emotionally engaged enough to facilitate change, but still emotionally safe and supported. This allows the deep exploration of feelings (as described in the Experiencing levels above) to occur in a way that is productive rather than retraumatizing. Arousal regulation is so important that one of the principles of EFT is explicitly Emotional Regulation – it’s considered a foundational skill that enables all the other steps of emotional processing to unfold ￼.

The CAMS Model of Emotion Processing

EFT researchers have developed a framework for understanding how people move through emotional states on the road to healing. One influential framework is the CAMS model, which stands for Classification of Affective-Meaning States. The CAMS model maps out a typical sequence of emotional processes that clients often experience in therapy, and it helps therapists recognize where a client is in that sequence. In essence, it outlines how raw feelings evolve into new meanings and relief when therapy is effective. This model identifies three broad phases of emotional processing: early distress, intermediate meaning-making, and advanced resolution ￼. Within these phases are specific emotional states (12 have been identified) that commonly occur in a sequence as the client works through a problem. Understanding this sequence informs the therapist’s interventions – it tells us what needs to happen next for the client to continue progressing emotionally.

Here is a simplified outline of the sequential emotional processing as described by the CAMS model (and related EFT research):
	1.	Initial Distress and Secondary Reaction: The process often begins with the client in an early expression of distress (EED) – this could be a state of global distress or a secondary, surface emotion. For example, a client might start by expressing a vague unhappiness, feeling generally overwhelmed (“I just feel awful about everything”), or by displaying a secondary emotion like generalized anger or frustration (“I’m so angry at how my life is going!”). In this stage, the emotional arousal is high but not yet specific or constructive – the person feels bad but isn’t yet in touch with the core of it ￼ ￼. The therapist’s task here is to help differentiate and clarify the emotion. Rather than staying in an unfocused cry of distress or a defensive anger, the client is gently guided to explore what’s underneath. For instance, beneath a client’s global anger, there might lurk a specific hurt or fear. Recognizing that the client is in this initial state, the therapist knows to validate the distress but also to begin probing for deeper feelings (“What about this is the hardest for you?”) instead of trying to problem-solve immediately.
	2.	Accessing Primary Maladaptive Emotion (Core Pain): As therapy drills down, the client moves into contact with a primary maladaptive emotion – this is often the core pain we discussed earlier (like shame, intense fear, or deep sadness linked to unmet needs). In the CAMS model, these are sometimes called “specific maladaptive emotions” because they have a definite theme (unlike the earlier global distress) ￼. For example, a client who started in global distress may begin to pinpoint, “I feel really ashamed, like I’m not good enough,” or a previously irritable client might break into tears and say, “I’m scared everyone will leave me.” This is a crucial and vulnerable step: the real underlying feeling has emerged. The CAMS coding identifies states here such as maladaptive fear/shame or feelings of abandonment. The therapist recognizes this shift as progress – the client is now engaging with the core maladaptive emotion that needs to change. The focus at this stage is on allowing and deepening the experience of this emotion, because exploring it fully will reveal what it’s about and what the person needs. Therapists may use techniques like focusing (“Stay with that feeling… what is it like?”) or chair work to let the client express the core pain. The client might say something like, “It’s like a little kid in me is just sobbing, ‘please don’t go, don’t leave me.’” While this is painful, it’s also productive, because the client is no longer stuck in diffuse upset – they’re confronting the specific wound.
	3.	Articulating the Unmet Need/Meaning: As the core maladaptive emotion is experienced, often an “existential need” or new meaning comes into focus ￼. The client begins to understand what they longed for or what was missing in that hurtful scenario. In the sequence, this corresponds to intermediate states of meaning/symbolization – essentially, the client puts words to what their heart needs/needed ￼. For instance, a client deep in shame might realize, “I needed to feel loved for who I am,” or someone feeling intense grief might realize, “I really needed you to acknowledge me; I needed to know I mattered.” This stage is powerful because the client moves from just feeling the pain to making meaning from it – identifying the why (“why am I so hurt? because I needed X and didn’t get it”). According to the CAMS model, two notable emotional states often occur around here: one is recognizing a negative evaluation (e.g. feeling anger that “What happened to me was wrong!”) and the other is naming the unmet need (“I needed this from you!”) ￼ ￼. Both represent a clearer organization of the emotional experience. The anger of negative evaluation is different from the unfocused rage earlier – it’s now targeted and meaningful (for example, anger that one was wronged, which implicitly asserts “I deserved better”). Likewise, stating the need (like “I deserved to be protected”) transforms the pain into a kind of demand or acknowledgement of one’s own worth. Therapists often reinforce this step by echoing the client’s realization (“Yes – you should have been protected; that was your basic need”). This solidifies the client’s new understanding and opens the door to the next phase: meeting that need in the here-and-now.
	4.	Activating Adaptive Emotion (Meeting the Need): With the core need out in the open, EFT then guides the client to generate a new, adaptive emotional response that addresses that need. In CAMS terms, the client moves into advanced meaning-making (AMM) – states that actually facilitate transformation ￼. Here we see emotions like assertive anger, adaptive grief, or self-compassion come forward. These are healthy emotions that have a clear purpose. For example, assertive anger (often called protective anger) might arise in a client who has articulated the need for respect – they might feel a strengthening energy saying “I won’t accept being treated that way anymore!” (This anger is not destructive rage, but a empowering force to set boundaries, which is adaptive). Adaptive grief could occur when someone acknowledges a painful loss and allows themselves to mourn properly – the tears of grief in this case help let go and move forward, which was the needed action. Self-compassion might flood in when a client recognizes their younger self’s pain and internally offers comfort (“You poor thing, you didn’t deserve that”). These new emotions are often facilitated by specific tasks: for instance, in a two-chair dialogue, a client might express anger at their critical self, or in an empty-chair with an imagined caregiver, they might weep and then say what they needed to hear, effectively giving themselves compassion or assertiveness. The key is that the adaptive emotion directly addresses the previously unmet need – it’s corrective. According to EFT principles, “an emotion is transformed by another emotion.” So, if the client was stuck in shame (believing “I’m bad and unlovable”), perhaps the adaptive emotional shift is a combination of sadness (grieving how they were mistreated) and anger (rejecting the idea that they are worthless) along with compassion (accepting themselves). These new emotions carry information like “I actually am worthy of love; I was hurt but I can heal.”
	5.	Resolution and Relief: Finally, as the adaptive emotions are integrated, the client often experiences a sense of relief, empowerment, or resolution. In CAMS, “Relief” is one of the later coded states, indicating that the emotional work has yielded a release of tension or a positive shift ￼. The client might physically relax, sigh, or even smile through tears. They often report a feeling that a weight has lifted or that something “clicked” internally. This is the payoff of moving through the emotional sequence – the once overwhelming or stuck feeling has been understood, transformed, and eased. In practical terms, the client’s behavior or outlook also changes: for example, after experiencing these shifts, a client might approach others differently, assert themselves more, or feel less haunted by the past. The new emotional resolution (like a sense of self-worth replacing shame, or forgiveness replacing anger) becomes part of the client’s emotional repertoire. To consolidate this, the therapist might help the client reflect on the journey: “You started feeling so helpless and now you’re standing up for yourself – how does that feel?” This helps reinforce the new, healthier emotional state as genuine and lasting.

It’s important to note that not every therapy session neatly moves through all these steps, and clients might cycle through parts of this sequence multiple times for different aspects of their experience. However, the CAMS model provides a roadmap of change. It informs the therapist where the client is in their emotional process and what intervention might be needed. For example, if a client is still in a secondary anger state (Step 1), the therapist knows to help them access the core pain (Step 2) rather than jumping to problem-solving. If the client is deeply feeling core pain but hasn’t articulated a need (Step 3), the therapist might gently ask, “What is it that this hurting part of you needed back then?” to facilitate that shift. And if the client has voiced their need but hasn’t experienced an empowering emotion (Step 4), the therapist might work on evoking that – perhaps by encouraging them to direct anger toward someone who hurt them or by role-playing giving comfort to their younger self. In sum, the CAMS model and sequential processing theory remind the therapist that emotional healing is a journey with distinct landmarks: from distress, to accessing vulnerability, to making meaning, to transforming emotion, and finally to relief. By following this map, EFT clinicians can more intentionally guide clients through their toughest emotions to reach true change.
