These experiences often bring strong positive emotions like joy, peace, and a well-developed sense of awareness (Messerly, 2017).<br><br>Someone who is highly self-transcendent may also experience “plateau experiences” in which they consistently maintain or enter a state of serenity and higher perspective (Messerly, 2017)."],
